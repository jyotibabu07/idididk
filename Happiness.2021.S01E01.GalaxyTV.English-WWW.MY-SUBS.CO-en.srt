- Get it done quick!

00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:50,077
Give me that.

00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:53,217
Jung Yi Hyun!

10
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,286
I played baseball as a kid too,
and I know how you feel!

11
00:01:56,786 --> 00:01:59,926
Come down here so we can talk!

12
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,687
Talk from down there.

13
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,497
- What's he saying?
- What was that?

14
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,867
Give him a megaphone too, then.

15
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,997
I'll come up there. Give me a moment.

16
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,066
Let's talk up there.

17
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,277
Where's the staircase?

18
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:23,117
He just won't come down.

19
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:25,486
Focus on your book.

20
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,247
If you're focused, you can't even hear...

21
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,656
a bomb go off next to you.

22
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,687
Class is over, so why are you still here?

23
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:33,827
It's not like you make us want to study.

24
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,796
If you all were to rush out,
would Yi Hyun appreciate it?

25
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,697
He's already stressed out and upset.

26
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,626
If he were to see you and
suddenly decides to jump,

27
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:46,006
you would really want to study then,
wouldn't you?

28
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:48,307
Can we leave if he comes down?

29
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:51,406
Yes. You can go straight home.

30
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,277
The police are negotiating with him.

31
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:56,117
Don't irritate me and go back to sleep.

32
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,886
You've been here longer than most.

33
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,517
It must be stressful for you too.

34
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:02,487
I need to go to the toilet.

35
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,987
I told you not to irritate...

36
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,957
Well, as long as you're quiet.

37
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:09,457
Focus, everyone. Focus.

38
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:11,596
Concentrate and ignore the bomb.

39
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:13,997
My gosh.

40
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:19,337
Hey, kid. I promise to make
sure you make a full recovery.

41
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:22,506
If not, I'll make you a cop.

42
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:24,876
Trust me and come down from there.

43
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:26,606
I don't want to be a cop.

44
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:27,946
Okay, wait!

45
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:34,346
I'm a friend and was told to
come over and help negotiate.

46
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:37,786
I will talk from here.
I won't go up to you.

47
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:39,856
Try to relax.

48
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:42,596
Yoon Sae Bom?

49
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,397
Hey, you!

50
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:46,397
Hey!

51
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:50,867
Hey! You there! Don't you go...

52
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:53,536
Who are you? Are you his girlfriend?

53
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:56,777
No. Hey, I can't go home because of you.

54
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:00,247
I'll talk to him,
Mister. You stay right there.

55
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:02,747
What's wrong with the students here?

(Seyang High School)

57
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,286
Are you upset you can't play baseball?

58
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:12,226
It's not that.

59
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:14,687
I came up for some air,

60
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,897
and suddenly police cars
and an ambulance rushed in.

61
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,927
What idiot called them?

62
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:24,267
I'm just watching to
see how far they'll go.

63
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,707
I have nothing better to do.

64
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:28,307
Is baseball the only thing you can do?

65
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,506
Yes. It's all I've ever done.

66
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:33,277
And I was pretty good at it, too.

67
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,976
Would you be okay if
this happened to you?

68
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:38,886
I've never done anything
my whole life and I was okay.

69
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,147
It's easier if you've
never done anything.

70
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,316
I was in a hospital for a long time,

71
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:45,427
and once it's over,
it becomes a fond memory.

72
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,297
I can never play baseball again.

73
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,057
My future, my life is ruined.

74
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,666
I don't know what to do...

75
00:04:57,336 --> 00:05:00,307
What about you, then? What will you do?

76
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,237
Until last week, I wanted to be a nurse.

77
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:04,807
Now I might be a civil servant.

78
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:07,177
I need a stable income
to live independently,

79
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:08,917
but I keep changing my mind.

80
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:11,016
See? You can't decide yourself,

81
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,547
just because you're two years behind.

82
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:13,886
No.

83
00:05:14,987 --> 00:05:18,117
I'm saying our future
comes with so many options.

84
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:23,256
It's fine. Just take the plunge.

85
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:25,357
You have nothing to lose.

86
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:31,136
My gosh.

87
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:44,516
Like me.

88
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:47,216
What?

89
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:13,646
Help him out!

90
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,747
Help him.

91
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:18,276
Help him!

92
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,716
- Are you okay?
- Be careful.

93
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:25,526
It's not like that.

94
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:26,687
I purposely pushed him...

95
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,956
so that he would land on the cushion.

96
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:51,316
Let's talk over there.

97
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:53,816
Hey!

98
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:55,787
Jung Yi Hyun.

99
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:58,256
Tell that man that you don't
want me to get punished.

100
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:00,287
They're going to arrest me.

101
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:01,357
Hey, Yoon Sae Bom.

102
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:09,097
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

What are you doing? Treat him!

109
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:23,636
Where did he get hurt?

110
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,107
He got shot in the chest,

111
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:26,547
and he can't breathe.

112
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:35,547
He has a pneumothorax.

Air is leaking from the gunshot
wound and putting pressure on the...

114
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:39,626
Don't give me a diagnosis. Treat him!

115
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:50,336
Should I really do it?

116
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,237
Don't think and do as you were taught.

117

You're going to break my ribs, you punk.

120
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,797
Sir.

121
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:34,106
This is the clavicle, you idiot.

Recruit Lee Jong Tae.

123
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,787
You just killed a team member.

124
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,257
You lose points in your TMP training.

Gosh, your acting was good today.

128
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,566
- Was it?
- Yes.

129
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,746
Put your gloves on.

130
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,106
That way you won't slip.

131
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:09,917
Keep up the good work.

132
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,177
Are you really going to deduct points?

133
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:14,586
Yes. He's slow to make a decision,
and he scares easily.

134
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:17,657
If you look at everyone
from your standard,

135
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:19,986
the entire world is slow, Sae Bom.

138
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,576
Okay.

139
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:41,446
He got a gunshot wound and can't breathe.

140
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:42,976
What should we do in times like this?

141
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:44,647
What the...

142
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,147
What is she doing?

143
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:48,586
Hey, you!

What are you doing?

146
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:55,657
They made this because of you.

147
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,127
Because you stabbed him
in the chest without thinking.

148
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:02,566
Then Captain Choi got
transferred to a patrol station.

149
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,836
He called recently and said he
found his calling at the patrol station.

150
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:07,907
Really?

151
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:10,007
He even sent me a gift certificate.

152
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,177
What about me?

153
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,507
Why didn't he send me one?

154
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:16,716
I'm sure there's a reason
why he didn't send you one.

161
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:49,917
Yes, I'll tell them.

162
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:55,647
What are they doing
first thing in the morning?

but isn't it nice to be able
to breathe in fresh air...

168
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:42,637
without wearing a mask?

169
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,937
The world is a bit different from
how it was before COVID-19,

170
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:49,537
but thanks to that we learned how
precious an ordinary day can be.

171
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,407
Dear listeners.

172
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:54,377
Smile when you see people's
faces without masks on...

173
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,446
and take in a deep breath as
you look up at the blue skies.

174
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:59,917
I hope your afternoon
is filled with happiness.

175
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,687
I hope you enjoy the rest of your day,

176
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:04,917
and I'll see you tomorrow at this...

177
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:08,627
(You never know when another
infectious disease might appear.)

178
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:13,866
(Jung Yi Hyun)

179
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:21,307
Here.

180
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:23,907
How can you still play baseball
when your knee is like that?

181
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:26,277
If I play as a proxy, they give me money.

182
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:28,206
- What's the case?
- A murder.

183
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,517
You didn't know what kind of
case we were investigating?

184
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,917
I came because you told me to come.

185
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:34,647
I gave up my day off
and a game to come here.

186
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:36,757
- You should be grateful.
- Goodness, I am.

187
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,956
So I looked...

188
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,157
The people next door called it in.

189
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:41,326
- I heard screaming, so I came out.
- Excuse me.

190
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:43,456
- Who died?
- The employee at the counter.

191
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,297
Let's go.

192
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:47,566
- You just need to testify properly.
- What is going on?

193
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:17,826
What do you think he did to his neck?

194
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,027
I'm not sure.

195
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,267
It looks like he was
cut with a dull knife.

196
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:25,267
Was he trying to kill him painfully?

197
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,767
What about the suspect?

198
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,137
The person who stayed in this room.

199
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:30,507
There were a lot of complaints
about how he was noisy.

200
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:33,547
Who covered him like this?

201
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:40,246
Did you guys touch the scene?

202
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,816
No, sir. We left it as is!

203
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:43,856
- Any witnesses?
- We haven't found any.

204
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:46,726
It was like this when they got here.

205
00:14:49,927 --> 00:14:51,326
Did they check the CCTV footage?

206
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:52,726
Oh, the CCTV...

207
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:54,826
Darn it.

208
00:14:57,836 --> 00:14:59,137
What about the CCTV footage?

209
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,466
They're looking at it right now.

210
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:04,736
They can't find the suspect leaving.

211
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:09,476
They covered the
deceased's face and ran away,

212
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,446
but there's no footage
of him leaving the place?

213
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:16,417
He must've signed in
electronically before his stay.

214
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,557
CDCH would never show us that.

215
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:20,657
It's a breach of the Personal
Information Protection Act.

216
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,726
Murders don't get to have human rights!

217
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,057
We should integrate all of
their information and catch them.

218
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,866
I don't understand.

219
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:33,066
Not you.

220
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:34,637
Right.

221
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:40,846
Nobody looked in here, right?

222
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:46,047
(Jung Yi Hyun)

223
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:57,297
Hey,
I know that you don't follow protocol...

224
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,326
and just want to get lucky
when you investigate, but...

225
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:01,297
When it comes to following protocol,
I'm not that bad.

226
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:05,566
I know someone who's even worse than...

227
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:09,236
Sir.

228
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:11,576
Come on out.

229
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:12,946
Are you kidding me?

230
00:16:14,377 --> 00:16:17,177
If you're pulling my leg again,
you're dead meat today.

231
00:16:20,716 --> 00:16:21,716
Come on!

232
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:23,387
Damn it. I looked into his eyes.

233
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:27,627
Gosh. We got the culprit. Don't come in.

234
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,387
You can come in later.

235
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,037
(ID card, Sung Woo Je)

236
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:41,667
Did you do this, Mr. Sung?

237
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:44,437
I don't know.

238
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:47,346
Did you put a blanket over him...

239
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:48,407
because you were scared to look at him?

240
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:51,017
Then why did you kill him?

241
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,917
You don't remember that either?

242
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:58,157
I had something like a dream.

243
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:01,157
Did you kill him in that dream?

244
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:07,667
You couldn't run away seeing
how you're covered in blood.

245
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:10,167
Your mind was scattered,
but the cops started flooding in.

246
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,736
That's why you probably hid.

247
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:13,566
Where's the murder weapon?

248
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,106
How did you kill him in your dream?

249
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:19,177
Right. Wait.

250
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:22,147
Without the murder weapon,
the court can't find you guilty.

251
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:26,486
Well,

252
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,517
I was very thirsty for some reason.

253
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,236
Did you bite him?

254
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:53,446
Give me one more.

255
00:17:57,446 --> 00:17:58,776
(Limited to one piece per
person for main dishes)

256

Do you work as a handyman or something?

257
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,766
Why are you eating so much rice?

258
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:17,236
I'm kind of hurt, so don't talk to me.

259
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:21,337

260
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:24,837
Talk to me if you need to.

(Public Rental Unit Notice
for Police at Le Ciel Apartment)

262
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:37,456
- What are you reading so intently?
- The new location...

263
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:38,786
where the Police Agency
building moved to...

264
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:40,327
is getting developed now.

265
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,627
Aren't they building apartments there?

266
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:44,256
They decided to give
out three special units...

267
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,897
for people in the police force.

268
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:47,526
Really? What are the conditions?

269
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,196
My wife's dream is to get a
unit in a newly built apartment.

270
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,597
They score every
applicant based on seniority,

271
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,637
the size of the family,
marital status, and so on.

272
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:57,736
But the number of arrests and
evaluations matter the most.

273
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,847
Gosh. If I get picked for that,
I'll win the unit for sure.

274
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,177
That would be hitting the jackpot.

275
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:05,016
Who could we arrest? What? Terrorists?

276
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,087
You never know.

277
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,756
Who knows? What if I
were to prove to them today?

278
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:13,327
Prove what?

279
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,456
I'm thinking.

280
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:29,437
Go easy at your game.
Don't get injured again.

281
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:30,837
Okay.

00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,446
Sae Bom,
did you pick up on a new religion?

284

286
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:51,996
What?

287
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,026
Your names came up
during an investigation.

288
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,726
Why?

289
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:57,966
You're training new recruits. Right?

290
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:00,536
He bought some drugs
from a new recruit for SOU.

291
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,946
I was told this drug
was 100 percent legal.

292
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:13,946
Your dealer just thought
you would never get caught.

293
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,256
Do you have any leftover?

294
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,786
I got about 3 to 4 pills.

295
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:21,387
But I took all of them.

296
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:23,427
What's the name of the new recruit?

297
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:24,496
Lee Jong Tae.

298
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,226

301
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:34,407
You'll be getting a notice soon. Anyway,
it's just a heads-up.

302
00:20:35,137 --> 00:20:36,137
Good job.

303
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:38,407
If I were to uncover the
organization behind it,

304
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:39,746
that would be my arrest. Right?

305
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,147
What are you talking about now?

306
00:20:41,546 --> 00:20:43,016
I just wanted you to know.

307
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:50,556
Gosh.

308
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:56,597
I'll be back very quickly.

309
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:58,256
So watch my food.

310
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:00,796
It's important than your food?

311
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,877
Gosh. That's not like her.

312
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:24,887
Don't worry. I warned everyone...

313
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:26,657
that they would be dead
meat if they eat your pork cutlet.

314

What are they doing?

315
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:32,256
No way. Are they doing it here?

316
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:34,397

Lee Jong Tae, stop right there.

322
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:22,847
Seung Young, get him out of here.

323
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,476
I'm going after your pelvis next.

take him and get him treated.

Hold on.

328

Call an ambulance, please.

Bring me the medicine cart.

336
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:29,206
Be careful not to get bitten.

338
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:57,367
- Yes?
- You should've told me

339
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,196
this was dangerous! I almost died!

340
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:01,706
What are you talking
about? Why would you die?

341
00:25:02,337 --> 00:25:04,607
How could he not feel any
pain even after getting shot?

342
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:07,046
Who shot whom? Hey, are you all right?

343
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:09,306
Of course, I'm all right.

344
00:25:10,016 --> 00:25:12,276
But how did you catch him without a gun?

345
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,187
I just convinced him. I talked to him.

346
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,456
How is that possible?
Could he be reasoned with?

347
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,587
Hey, tell me exactly what happened.

348
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:21,986
Did you see Lee Jong Tae?

349
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:23,256
Yes.

350
00:25:24,196 --> 00:25:27,327
Did he try to bite you?

351
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:28,496
So you know.

352

Are you all right?

356
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:40,976
Hey, answer me.

357
00:25:41,177 --> 00:25:42,177
Yes.

358
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:46,016
Why won't you answer? You're scaring me.

359

This is the women's toilet.

361
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,306
The man you shot.

362
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:47,806
He could have an infectious disease.

363
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,056
What infectious disease?

364
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,657
We're looking into that.

370
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,107
Hand me your weapon...

371
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:19,677
and cooperate with the investigation.

The National Police Agency
will issue instructions soon,

376
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,377
but officially,
what just happened was an accident.

377

Remember to stay silent.

378
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:58,476
We're taking Corporal Yoon
because she could be infected.

00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,657
No, don't hang up.

I'm Corporal Jung from
Seyang Police Station.

Can you please tell me what's going on?

384
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,296
Corporal Yoon Sae Bom...

385
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:20,067
will be tested as she had
contact with an infected recruit.

386
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:24,637
So she's okay right now?

387
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:27,847
She's an essential worker,
so she got two doses of the vaccine.

388
00:28:28,046 --> 00:28:30,446
What infection are you talking about?

389
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:31,817
We must find out.

390
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,716
- Goodbye.
- It was Lee Jong Tae, wasn't it?

391
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:35,617
The infected recruit.

392
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:40,427
We arrested a murder suspect
who was in contact with him.

393
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:42,087
Did you just say murder?

394
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:44,157
He bit a man's neck.

395
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:47,097
Is that related to the infection?

396
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:50,597
Seyang Police Station,
right? I'll come over.

397

Just a moment.

398
00:28:52,036 --> 00:28:54,736
Should those who were
in contact be quarantined?

399
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,976
If they were bitten or scratched.

413

civilians, the army,

You mean to say...

the infectious disease
makes people bite others?

416

We believe it's a variant
virus that affects the brain.

and now they bite to infect?

that pill?

No.

431
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:05,897
Could it be...

432
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,736
a hallucinatory side effect instead?

433
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,966
That's impossible,

Yes. I guess he was infected.

00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:31,017
Wake me up when you're done.

496
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:41,157
Open up.

497
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:56,637
Are you going to take my blood too?

498
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:38,517
What is this place?

499
00:36:39,617 --> 00:36:41,718
It doesn't look like a
hospital. Is it a school?

500
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:43,318
Someone who's been
in contact with a disease

501
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:44,918
that makes you rip
people's throats out...

502
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:45,918
should be away from people.

503
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:50,458
Will I end up like Recruit Lee Jong Tae?

504
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:00,907
I'm just kidding.

505
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,068
I'm not going to bite.

506
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:05,077
- You'll end up getting hurt.
- Right,

507
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:06,577
so can you give me an answer?

508
00:37:11,278 --> 00:37:13,017
I thought you were going
to put some ointment on me.

509
00:37:19,718 --> 00:37:22,787
What should I do until
the results come in?

510
00:37:24,557 --> 00:37:25,557
Testify.

511
00:37:26,898 --> 00:37:28,668
Tell me about what happened today.

512
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:34,668
I saw Recruit Lee Jong
Tae attack a colleague,

513
00:37:34,738 --> 00:37:36,108
and I tried to stop him.

514
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:37,977
How did Lee Jong Tae look?

515
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:39,338
He didn't look well.

516
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,608
Can you be more specific?

517
00:37:41,278 --> 00:37:43,677
Both his eyes were cloudy...

518
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:45,177
as though they had cataracts,

519
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:48,588
and he acted like a beast
as he tried to bite me.

520
00:37:49,218 --> 00:37:50,218
I shot him twice,

521
00:37:50,287 --> 00:37:52,557
but it seemed like
he didn't feel any pain.

522
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:54,827
Is this...

523
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:57,557
similar to rabies?

524
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:00,557
It is.

525
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:04,068
A detective friend of mine
said he might've been on drugs.

526
00:38:04,968 --> 00:38:07,097
When someone goes crazy and bites people,

527
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:09,238
the police will believe
that it's because of drugs.

528
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:11,177
Interpreting it like that
makes things easier.

529
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:14,878
And from your perspective,
an infectious disease is better.

530
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:17,008
People will see things
as they want to believe.

531
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:18,517
But...

532
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:21,387
Aren't you a police officer too?

533
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:24,617
We're counter-terrorism experts.

534
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:26,657
We just get paid through
the National Police Agency.

535
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,197
Will Recruit Lee Jong Tae...

536
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:36,898
be okay?

537
00:38:37,637 --> 00:38:39,168
He's recuperating miraculously.

538
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:43,307
I'll prepare a place for you to
rest until the test results come out.

539
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:46,238
Wait. Aren't you going to
give me back my phone?

540
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:48,148
I'll bring a phone to your room.

Hello?

543
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,307
This is all your fault!

544
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:19,878
Yoon Sae Bom? Are you okay?

545
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:23,307
Yes. It's cleaner than the
civil servants apartments.

546
00:39:23,548 --> 00:39:25,577
That place was built over 50 years ago.

547
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:27,847
The roof leaks when it rains,
and the pipes freeze in the winter.

548
00:39:28,188 --> 00:39:30,318
How can they put 3 people in
1 house because they're single?

549
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:31,718
Gosh, it's cold.

550
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:38,358
Will the electricity bill be okay?

551
00:39:38,427 --> 00:39:40,628
How do you feel? Did you get tested?

552
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:42,597
Yes. Everything but an endoscopy.

553
00:39:42,668 --> 00:39:45,637
Goodness. I got my
health check for the year.

554
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,338
They want me to stay here
until the test results come out.

555
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:50,977
I talked to your mom.

556
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:52,608
You couldn't wait half a day?

557
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,847
Hey. No news is good news.

558
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,307
Don't worry.

559
00:39:57,378 --> 00:39:59,847
I told her that you won't be
reachable because of training.

560
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:03,588
Right. You're tactful enough.

561
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:06,157
I'm looking into
what all this is about...

562
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:08,458
Where are you?

563
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:11,128
No idea. It looks like
a school dormitory.

564
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:13,958
It's not like they're going to kill me.

565
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:15,298
I'm not feeling sick,

566
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:18,097
so I can just catch up on some
rest while I wait for the test results.

567
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:20,867
The drug test results
for our suspect came out,

568
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:22,468
and he's clean.

569
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:24,708
Really?

570
00:40:25,878 --> 00:40:27,378
Is it really an infectious disease?

571
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:29,208
I think it's drugs.

572
00:40:30,447 --> 00:40:31,617
You're definitely a police officer.

573

What do you mean?

574
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:34,887
It's nothing.

575
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:38,218
In any case, I'll...

576
00:40:38,588 --> 00:40:41,458
catch the culprit so that
you can get peace of mind.

577
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:43,387
So just get some rest there. Okay?

578
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:45,298
Okay. I'll be waiting.

579
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:46,528
It's late. Go to bed.

Oral pneumonia medication.

It has a lot of side effects,
so it was taken off the market quickly.

00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:56,787
Do you see that?

659
00:47:58,028 --> 00:47:59,628
You scratched me.

660
00:48:00,898 --> 00:48:02,427
People here tell me that
there's an infectious disease,

661
00:48:02,427 --> 00:48:03,468
but I'm not sure about that.

662
00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:05,438
I need to know...

663
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:07,298
if this happened...

664
00:48:08,238 --> 00:48:09,668
because of the infectious disease...

665
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,438
or the drugs, Jong Tae.

666
00:48:14,278 --> 00:48:16,548
That way,
I'll be relaxed when I take the test.

667
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:22,718
Can I have some water?

668
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:23,887
Never!

669
00:48:24,188 --> 00:48:25,517
I'm so thirsty.

670
00:48:26,057 --> 00:48:27,157
She said no.

671
00:48:30,628 --> 00:48:31,798
I'm thirsty.

672
00:48:36,798 --> 00:48:38,497
Hey. What are you doing?

673
00:48:39,197 --> 00:48:40,838
Open your eyes. I'm
not done talking to you.

674
00:48:46,577 --> 00:48:47,637
Hey.

675
00:49:02,427 --> 00:49:03,557
Lee Jong Tae.

676
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:36,688
Get away from me.

677
00:49:36,827 --> 00:49:38,327
Get away...

678
00:50:25,037 --> 00:50:26,307
Lieutenant Colonel Han.

679
00:50:27,278 --> 00:50:28,378
You're watching, right?

680
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,161
You will be near the destination shortly.

681
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:01,571
(We Are Against
Redevelopment Without a Plan)

682
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,670
You have arrived at the destination.

683
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,571
The GPS guidance is complete.

684
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,810
What's the purpose of your visit?

685
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:15,951
Isn't this Wonjung University?

686
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:17,411
It lost its accreditation for
its poor-quality education.

687
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,321
Currently,
the military is using the property.

688
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,920
I'm from the police.

689
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,520
Can I see your supervisor?

690
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,690
This is a secret military
base. So that won't be possible.

691
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,161
Then...

692
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,630
can you tell Lieutenant
Colonel Han Tae Seok...

693
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:36,831
that I brought the drug
we talked about before?

694
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,241
Let him in.

695
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,891
You wanted me to see Lee Jong Tae, right?

696
00:51:55,351 --> 00:51:56,790
You even installed a camera there.

697
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,420
I wanted to know when
he would get thirsty.

698
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:02,790
Thirsty?

699
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,661
Once infected, people lose their
sanity and start biting people off.

700
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,230
They start to feel
this insatiable thirst.

701
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:10,400
And water won't do the job.

702
00:52:18,741 --> 00:52:21,281
Even if they return to their normal self,
they repeatedly feel...

703
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,551
thirsty and go crazy again.

704
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,150
And I'm trying to figure
out when they get thirsty.

705
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:26,750
So I was curious...

706
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:29,290
how Lee Jong Tae would
behave when he saw you.

707
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,991
You wanted to know how he would behave...

708
00:52:30,991 --> 00:52:32,360
when he saw the person who shot him.

709
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,491
He recognizes his family.

710
00:52:35,261 --> 00:52:36,831
I was wondering if
he'd recognize you too.

711
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:39,630
That wasn't everything.

712
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,500
His heart beats slower.

713
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,400
And he seems to feel less pain.

714
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:46,701
His wounds heal faster.

715
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:50,670
As long as we can control it,
it will be very helpful.

716
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:57,610
So you must be
researching this in secret.

717
00:52:58,581 --> 00:53:01,790
It's not as infectious as other diseases,
but it will scare people.

718
00:53:01,891 --> 00:53:04,090
People are already fatigued
regarding infectious diseases.

719
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,491
There's no need to alarm the public.

720
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:17,000
Then why do you keep
the air conditioner running?

721
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:19,900
Low temperature can
delay the rate of spread.

722
00:53:26,181 --> 00:53:27,440
Is this a test too?

723
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:29,581
To see if I'm thirsty or not?

724
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:33,081
You really tested negative.

725
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,721
I'm not that lucky usually.

726
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,721
Why don't you take a break?

727
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:42,630
Here?

728
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,161
Wherever you wish to be.

729
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:49,630
Do you mean that? That's possible?

730
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,770
Say you served your country...

731
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:56,071
and was hurt mentally and
physically in the process.

732
00:53:56,741 --> 00:53:59,310
We must draw your blood every two weeks.

733
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,710
You don't yet have symptoms.

734
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,781
It could be that you have antibodies.

735
00:54:08,351 --> 00:54:10,121
(Temporary Pass, Important)

736
00:54:15,491 --> 00:54:17,531
I guess I'm pretty important.

737
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,701
Do me one more thing.

738
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:27,340
You said I did well to serve my country.

739
00:54:28,511 --> 00:54:31,110
Give me the highest
evaluation for this year's work.

740
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,980
What?

741
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:34,781
Seyang's public rental apartment.

742
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:36,380
The police force gets three units.

743
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:37,920
They grade us with a point system.

744
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:39,681
The size of the family, marital status,

745
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:41,520
seniority, evaluations.

746
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,590
All that's added up.

747
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,460
You have that much influence, don't you?

748
00:54:49,931 --> 00:54:51,531
I think I can do that.

749
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:54,900
You do have a pretty good record.

750
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:56,670
I'm the best.

751
00:54:57,071 --> 00:54:58,801
I was born to fight terrorism.

752
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,610
I'm glad you're easy to talk to.

753
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,181
We don't shake hands anymore.

754
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,451
My phone.

755
00:55:16,391 --> 00:55:18,721
Don't you even serve breakfast?

756
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:29,431
Thank you. I'll make it
last when I get home.

757
00:55:33,971 --> 00:55:35,270
Do you have a boyfriend?

758
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,480
It's not that I dislike you,

759
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,051
but the age gap is too big.

760
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:48,621
Even the best evaluation
won't get you enough points.

761
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,121
You'll need more.

762
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,761
I'm asking if you plan to marry soon.

763
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,960
Plans? I can start making them.

764
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:56,560
Aren't you worried at all?

765
00:55:57,931 --> 00:55:59,761
I will get an apartment.

766
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:01,801
You needn't worry about me.

767
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:04,301
I mean about what you
saw yesterday and today.

768
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:06,241
If things go wrong,

769
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:09,241
the world we know could change.

770
00:56:10,641 --> 00:56:12,411
What difference will worrying make?

771
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,610
The world might not change.

772
00:56:30,031 --> 00:56:31,031
Ma'am.

773
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:33,161
Where are my clothes?

774
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,331
We burned them.

775
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,601
No...

776
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,400
Should I wear this to go home?

777
00:56:43,641 --> 00:56:45,340
Sae Bom? Hey.

778
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:47,281
Are you all right? Let's see.

779
00:56:52,851 --> 00:56:54,920
You still don't trust me.

780
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:57,851
That's so upsetting.

781
00:56:59,221 --> 00:57:00,520
I'm fine. I can go home.

782
00:57:03,891 --> 00:57:05,360
Sorry for getting you into this.

783
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:08,471
You look gaunt.

784
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:10,971
I do? I didn't get any breakfast.

785
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:14,141
How did you get in here?

786
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,440
Did they bring you in? Were you bitten?

787
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:19,040
No. I came to save you.

788
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:23,411
Wait here. I need to
go in and have a chat.

789
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,020
Not bad.

790
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:47,201
You could play baseball again.

791
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:54,310
Is this...

792
00:57:55,051 --> 00:57:56,150
that pill?

793
00:57:56,210 --> 00:58:00,281
Yes. It's a failed pneumonia cure.

794
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:02,621
Way too many people have taken it so far.

795
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,960
It can't have caused the madness,

796
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,590
but I promised, so here it is.

797
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,590
Just because it was fine yesterday...

798
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,560
doesn't mean it'll be fine today.

799
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,440
Bye.

800
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,610
Let's go. I'll take you home.

801
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:01,310
Yes. He was next to me all along.

802
00:59:05,502 --> 00:59:06,502
Yi Hyun.

803
00:59:08,402 --> 00:59:10,241
Are you seeing someone?

804
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:11,872
What a random question.

805
00:59:11,942 --> 00:59:13,442
- Are you?
- No.

806
00:59:13,511 --> 00:59:15,241
Do you snore or grind your teeth?

807
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:16,741
I don't think so.

808
00:59:16,982 --> 00:59:18,111
Shall we get married?

809
00:59:20,451 --> 00:59:21,451
Jung Yi Hyun.

810
00:59:21,622 --> 00:59:24,082
Tell that man that you don't
want me to get punished.

811
00:59:24,752 --> 00:59:25,922
They're going to arrest me.

812
00:59:26,051 --> 00:59:27,152
Hey, Yoon Sae Bom.

813
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:31,391
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

814
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,531
No.

815
00:59:40,031 --> 00:59:43,502
I told you that day that I was kidding.

816
00:59:44,442 --> 00:59:45,872
I'm not kidding.

817
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:47,942
I mean it.

818
00:59:59,192 --> 01:00:03,922
(Happiness)

819
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:31,152
If people suddenly start to go mad...

820
01:00:32,352 --> 01:00:34,752
You asked me to look into Han Tae Seok.

821
01:00:36,661 --> 01:00:38,261
I really hate that guy.

822
01:00:38,562 --> 01:00:40,391
I got a new apartment.

823
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:43,531
It's locked. This floor and
below is public rental housing.

824
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:45,471
The higher floors are general sales.

825
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:47,531
A reporter called me.

826
01:00:48,272 --> 01:00:49,502
There's a way...

827
01:00:49,571 --> 01:00:51,471
- to make money and stay safe.
- Lee Seung Young!

828
01:00:51,772 --> 01:00:53,212
There's a problem at the dormitory.

829
01:00:53,272 --> 01:00:55,442
Where are the critically ill patients?

830
01:00:56,082 --> 01:00:57,741
Aren't they living people?

831
01:00:58,482 --> 01:00:59,951
More will get hurt if we stall.
