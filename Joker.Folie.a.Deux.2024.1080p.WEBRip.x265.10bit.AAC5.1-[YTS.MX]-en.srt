Morning, sir.

28
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,345
Nothing good about it.

29
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:36,738
Get up!

30
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,485
Let's go, get up.

31
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,879
Let's go boys.
Let's get this show on the road.

32
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:49,185
Come on! Come on!

33
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,665
Come on, get out of bed.

34
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:51,666
Let's go, get up.

35
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,495
Clean this fucking mess up.

36
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:56,975
Hey, Jackie, I need a hand.

37
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,240
Put some clothes on.

38
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:01,850
Diaz, what the fuck?

39
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,122
You got a joke for me today?

40
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:14,776
Move!

41
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,476
All right, come on,
let's go, guys.

42
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,913
Move your fucking ass. Move.

43
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,657
Don't test me, Walters.

44
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:28,268
Come on, boys.

45
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,444
Get him on the ground.

46
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,489
Move your fucking ass, Bullock.

47
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:33,577
Fuck you!

48
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:36,319
Get the fuck out my cell.

49
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:39,888
Leave me alone.

50
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,890
Hey, Arthur, you feelin'
crazy today or what?

51
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,719
I don't wanna come out today.

52
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,242
Take him down to F Ward.

53
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,983
I don't wanna come out today.

54
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,377
You got a big day today.
You better put on a happy face.

55
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,856
Get the fuck off me.

56
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,877
Let's not do this again, Beanie.

57
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:18,927
Shut up!

58
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,544
Let's go, Arthur.

59
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,372
Come on, Fleck.

60
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:31,722
Don't need your fancy lawyer
blaming me if you're late.

61
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,246
She knows how much you like me, right?

62
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,815
Hey, Fleck,
you got a joke for us today?

63
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,471
Yeah,
it's been a while, hasn't it?

64
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:11,936
Move.

65
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:26,995
Right on the line.

66
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,432
Let's go!

67
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,260
Back the fuck up, Ken.

68
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,218
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go on, front of the line.

69
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,918
Fleck. Fleck's next, my dear.

70
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,790
Hey, stay in line.

71
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:40,835
Yeah, you heard him.

72
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:44,969
Hey, hey, hey, back up.

73
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:48,756
Freak bit me!

74
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:54,152
Go.

75
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,598
All that kid's done
since he got here
is fucking smile.

76
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:07,209
And today, all of a sudden,
he bites Moran?

77
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,124
It's because nobody likes Moran.

78
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:11,082
He was at Gotham State
for, like, eight years

79
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,476
before he got here,
and he's still a fucking temp.

80
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,660
Hey, Fleck,
you got a joke for us today?

81
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,532
I already asked him.

82
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:26,924
I got a joke for ya.

83
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:33,061
This guy's dog dies, right?
And he really loved this dog.

84
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:38,240
So, he goes down to the church,
and he asks Father Mulcahy

85
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,982
if he'd perform
a funeral for him. Right?

86
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:44,551
And Mulcahy says, "Oh, no.
I'm sorry my son,

87
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,815
we can't have a service
for an animal in our church.

88
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,686
Uh, but, I bet if you go down

89
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,906
- to the veterinarian in town..."
-  Fuck.

90
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,342
"...he can do it
for you. You see?"

91
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,257
Goddamn it, Arthur.

92
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,564
Uh, so the guy says,
"Oh, thanks very much, Father."

93
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,392
And he says,
"Do you think two grand

94
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,394
would be enough
to cover the service?"

95
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,702
Father Mulcahy looks at him...

96
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,663
"Why didn't you tell me
the dog was Catholic?"

97
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:15,495
Eh?

98
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:16,539
Clean yourself up.

99
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:17,845
You like that one, Arthur?

100
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,936
Let's go.

101
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,851
"Why didn't you tell me
the dog was a Catholic?"

102
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,692
Look around, Arthur.

103
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,781
This is how
the other half lives.

104
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:26,348
Could have been all yours

105
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:27,218
if you hadn't killed
five people.

106
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,221

Hey!

113
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:08,042
Come on. You fucking lunatic.

114
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,267
Jesus Christ, you couldn't
get him a fucking umbrella?

115
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,400
Aw, come on, counselor,

116
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,228
you know we can't
give these boys umbrellas.

117
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:21,882
It's for their own good.

118
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,753
Oh, don't give me your shit.
He's soaking wet.

119
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:25,668
Well, those are the rules,
counselor,

120
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:28,018
but I'll break them
if you ask me.

121
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,280
I bet you would.

122
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:30,847
Mm-hm.

123
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,544
Oh, you're welcome, by the way,

124
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,894
for getting him
all cleaned up for you.

125
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,158
Sit down.

126
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,204
Here, Arthur.

127
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:46,733
Today,
we're meeting with Dr. Beatty.

128
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:47,908
Remember her?

129
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,172
She's gonna be
videotaping you this time,

130
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,305
so we can show it at your
competency hearing next week.

131
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,830
And if they find you competent,

132
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,875
and they will, they always do,

133
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,877
then we're going to trial.

134
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:07,144
You need to be in an actual
hospital with actual doctors.

135
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,495
Not this
Department of Corrections...

136
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,672
bullshit with these thugs.

137
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,633
Dr. Beatty thinks
that with everything

138
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:19,940
that happened to you
in your childhood,

139
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,159
it caused a split...

140
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:27,164
this fragmentation in you...

141
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:29,166
...to help you cope
with your pain.

142
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:34,563
She believes you have another
person living inside of you.

143
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:39,568
And it was this other person
who committed those crimes.

144
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,964
Do you understand
what that means, Arthur?

145
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,361
<i>I'll be asking you
a few questions today, Arthur,
okay?</i>

146
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,194
<i>Maybe you don't remember
some things?</i>

147
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:00,067
<i>Or you're confused
about what you did?</i>

148
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,983
<i>I'm here to help you
try and sort out what happened.</i>

149
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:15,343
Arthur, I'm not here
only to help with your defense.

150
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,085
I'm here for you.

151
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,479
<i>But for me to do my job,</i>

152
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:25,266
<i>I need you to be
candid with me.</i>

153
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,658
<i>Does that make sense?</i>

154
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:30,793
<i>Can I have a cigarette?</i>

155
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,490
<i>Of course you can.</i>

156
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:40,542
<i>Let's start
with the first incident, okay?</i>

157
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:46,983
<i>The three men who accosted you
on the subway, who bullied you,</i>

158
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,420
<i>did it feel like they
triggered something painful?</i>

159
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,161
<i>From your past? Your childhood?</i>

160
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,556
Do you remember
any of what happened?

161
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,432
Did you... black out?

162
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:03,086
See bright lights?

163
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:05,872
Mm...

164
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,138
Okay.

165
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:16,708
How about Murray Franklin?

166
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:20,930
What, if anything, do you
remember about that night?

167
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:29,678
<i>The music.</i>

168
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,944
<i>That's good.
Arthur, that is good.</i>

169
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,688
Can I tell you what I remember
about that night?

170
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:45,346
I remember you came out
dressed as Joker.

171
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:50,917
And I remember Joker
was dancing to that music.

172
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:52,788
<i>Right?</i>

173
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:57,184
<i>I really liked his band.</i>

174
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:03,538
<i>My mom and I u-- used
to watch the show together.</i>

175
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,062
<i>She liked
Murray Franklin as well?</i>

176
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,675
<i>"He's so handsome.</i>

177
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,634
<i>Look at those
sparkling white teeth."</i>

178
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,421
Is that your mother's voice?

179
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:19,510
Mm.

180
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:20,816
Do you often hear her voice
in your head?

181
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,385
All the time.

182
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,825
Did it change
at all after she died?

183
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,262
What does that mean?

184
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:33,916
Did you...

185
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,659
this other part of you...

186
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,575
Joker...

187
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,752
Did it come out more
after she died?

188
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,494
You lived together, right?
In a one-bedroom apartment?

189
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,589
Maybe I could talk to Joker
about it.

190
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:57,940
Would he like to talk to me?

191
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:27,927
Hey, Arthur.

192
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,972
Arthur.

193
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,148
I mean,
he'll do anything. Anything.

194
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:34,150
The guards said you wanted
to show me how to kiss.

195
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,547
But they said Joker's
a really good kisser.

196
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,245
Nobody's ever gave me
a kiss before.

197
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:47,685
Twenty bucks
says he chokes him.

198
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,434
There you go.

199
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,263
Ricky don't know what hit him.

200
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:01,961
There was no hesitation.

201
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,440
Yeah, yeah.

202
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:04,441
Kinda like...

203
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,793
I gotta be honest with you,
Arthur.

204
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:12,188
I wouldn't have took you
for a hopeless romantic.

205
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,581
Can I have a cigarette?

206
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,366
Why not.

207
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,020
Oh, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

208
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:20,022
He doesn't get a cigarette
unless he tells a joke.

209
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,068
No, come on. He still
makes us laugh, doesn't he?

210
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,070
Barely.

211
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,114
Hey.

212
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,248
Remember that music class
we saw?

213
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,946
The other day? B Ward?

214
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,079
Remember, with all the singing?

215
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,038
I got you in.
We're going next week.

216
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,258
Bullshit.

217
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,912
- The fuck you do that for?
- Eh, eh. No, no.

218
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,958
Went and saw Kellerman,
I said...

219
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,047
you've been good.
You deserve it.

220
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,702
The hell is he thinking?

221
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,573
Yeah.

222
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:52,011
He knows he can get
some good press for it.

223
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,230
Plus, I told him
I'd go along with him.

224
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:55,623
Oh, ho, there it is.

225
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:57,712
That explains it.

226
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,801
Count! Let's go.

227
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:01,194
Line up by two.

228
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:03,500
Ricky. Come on, Romeo,
line 'em up.

229
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:06,199
Let's go. Twos.
Line up by twos.

230
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:07,156
Come on, let's go.

231
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,245
Are you being serious?

232
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,507
I am being serious.

233
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,379
On the Bible.

234
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,990
Wasn't that hard, either.

235
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,125
Ever since they made
that TV movie about you,

236
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,344
everybody still thinks
you're a star.

237
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,956
How about you, Arthur?

238
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,524
Do you still think
you're a star?

239
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,702

Group, I want you to welcome
Arthur Fleck.

264
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,397
Now, I know it's odd to have
an inmate from E Ward in here,

265
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:27,530
but I have been assured
he's been a model patient

266
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,271
without any incidents.

267
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,711
I know this might feel strange,
Mr. Fleck, a new environment.

268
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:38,541
You see, we use music
in this class to make us whole,

269
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,065
to balance
the conflicting forces, the...

270
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:45,418
...the fractures
within ourselves.

271
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,638
All I ask is that you sing,

272
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:51,250
if and when
you're ready to sing.

273
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,079
Okay, let's go.

277
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,960
How about this one? Try this.

278
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:08,615
No, no, no, I can't really.
Look, I don't know it.

279
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,704
Okay. Um...

280
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:11,792
Oh, this one.

281
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,402
Is it really you?

282
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,404
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-  Yeah? Great.

283
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:16,666

291
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,514

So, what's a nice guy like you
doing in a place like this?

295
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,177
I killed five people.

296
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,353
One live on national television.

297
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:53,529
What about you?

298
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:57,925
I set fire to my parents'
apartment building.

299
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,060
Actually...

300
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:05,846
...it was six.

301
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,153
Nobody knows,
but also I killed my mother.

302
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:13,941
I should have done that.

303
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,639
My mother had me committed.

304
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,554
She says I'm psychotic.

305
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,342
You know, I must've watched
that TV movie

306
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,213
they made about you,
like, 20 times.

307
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,911
Yeah. Was it good?

308
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,871
They won't let me watch it.

309
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:32,089
It was good.

310
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,918
It was really good.

311
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:37,530
I grew up
in the same neighborhood.

312
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,358
Me and my friends
used to take that staircase

313
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:41,360
to school every day.

314
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,319
My parents didn't
give a fuck about me either.

315
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:46,321
My father beat the shit
out of me.

316
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,370
Well, guess what?

317
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:53,154
"Knock, knock."

318
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:55,548
"Sorry, kid, your dad
was killed in a car accident."

319
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,990
Sorry. That's not funny.

320
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:10,606
If only those friends
could see me now.

321
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:16,482
When I first saw Joker,

322
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:19,223
when I saw you
on <i>Murray Franklin,</i>

323
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,444
the whole time I was watching,
I kept thinking,

324
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:26,274
"I hope this guy
blows his brains out."

325
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,541
And then you did.

326
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:41,942

I didn't feel so alone anymore.

<i>The Murray Franklin Show?</i>

337
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:39,434
What's that?

338
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,612
That I didn't shoot first and
let him ask me questions later.

339
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:47,703

340
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,272

357
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,197

Hey, Fleck.

403
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,647
<i>- I told you before, I set up...

405
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:47,263
Okay, but Kellerman asked me
to make a statement now.

406
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:48,874
He's letting me go
to this movie tonight.

407

He's signing my book.

432
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:02,904

how this is gonna end.

434
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,823

00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:11,521

444
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,318
<i>He danced on the stairs,
didn't he?</i>

445
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:26,885
<i>Now, I happened to play Oedipus
the King on the same stairs.</i>

There's my guy.

523
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:01,017
Are you really here?

524
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:02,280
Yeah.

525
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,066
One of the guards let me in.

526
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,548
I'd do anything for you.

527
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:14,074
But we don't have a lot of time.
Come here.

528
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:15,380
What?

529
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,817
Come on. Can you get up?

530
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,734
Come into the light.

531
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,527
They're sending me home.

532
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:36,096
What? Why?

533
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:38,968
They're saying you're
a bad influence on me.

534
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:42,363
What?

535
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:47,063
This is gonna be good for us.

536
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,717
Now, I can be at your trial
every day.

537
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:50,719
I can see you every day
until you get out.

538
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:54,636
And then what?

539
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,945
We're gonna build a mountain.

540
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,690
Wait, wait.

541
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,182
You brought make-up.

542
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,316
I want to see the real you.

543
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:49,343
Look what they did to you.

544
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,473
It's just us now.

545
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:44,964
You need to stop
taking your medication.

546
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:46,792
I already have.

547
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,378
Can you do it?

548
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:09,771
Yeah.

549
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,464
What's he gonna ask me about?

550
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,988
Besides... you know.

551
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:57,166
Well, hopefully,
about your life in here,

552
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:00,387
and what the conditions
are really like in this place.

553
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:04,391
He might ask you about Lee.

554
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:07,525
She's been out there giving
a lot of interviews about you.

555
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:08,743
And about herself.

556
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:10,702
Good.

557
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:13,313
You know, I love her.

558
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:16,403
She gets me.

559
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:19,232
Two minutes. Paddy's ready.

560
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,451
Arthur.

561
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,325
This is a chance for you to show
a different side of yourself.

562
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:29,938
So the public can see
who you really are.

563
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:31,331
And I don't think
you should smoke.

564
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:33,638
I think it makes you
look cavalier.

565
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:34,639
Okay.

566
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:36,815
We need to use this time

567
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,731
to show people
that you're human.

568
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:43,996
They need to understand
you were sick. Delusional.

569
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,519
Mm-hm.

570
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:49,392
You're not Joker.
You're Arthur Fleck.

571
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,785
Hm?

572
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,136
Don't worry.
You're gonna be great.

573
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:58,619
Arthur.

574
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:05,800
Are you okay? It's--

575
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,151
It's not too late to cancel.

576
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:19,161
So, uh... you want me
to call you Arthur or The Joker?

577
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:21,163
Mr. Meyers,
you know we have an agreement.

578
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:22,991
You can't call him "Joker."

579
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:25,385
It's Arthur. Arthur Fleck.

580
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:28,954
When you're ready, Paddy.

581
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:31,521
She has to leave now.

582
00:43:32,348 --> 00:43:33,262
You can watch
from behind the glass,

583
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,350
but you can't be in here.

584
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:36,831
Just be yourself.

585
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,408
- We rolling?
- Rolling.

586
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:52,499
<i>Cameras up.</i>

587
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:56,329
<i>Two years ago,
the name Arthur Fleck</i>

588
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,723
<i>hit Gotham like a hurricane.</i>

589
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:00,899
An unassuming part-time
party clown

590
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:03,075
and struggling stand-up comic,

591
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:05,947
Fleck committed
five horrific murders

592
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:08,167
in the span of just four weeks.

593
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:11,997
And now, with hundreds
already lining up to get a seat

594
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:15,348
at one of the first trials
ever broadcast live on TV,

595
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:18,220
<i>Arthur Fleck, The Joker,</i>

596
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,483
<i>is sitting down
for his first interview</i>

597
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,486
<i>since that infamous night
on</i> Murray Franklin.

598
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,925
<i>And yes, we all know
how that turned out.</i>

599
00:44:30,493 --> 00:44:32,757
Arthur Fleck, welcome.

600
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,672
Hello.

601
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:39,372
Take me back to that night
onstage with Murray Franklin.

602
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:43,158
What was going
through your mind...

603
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:45,683
when you pulled out that gun
and blew his brains out?

604
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,428
Well, Paddy, um...

605
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:59,000
I was going through a lot
back then. Um...

606
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:03,091
I don't really remember much
from that night. I, uh...

607
00:45:03,265 --> 00:45:06,007
blacked out,
I saw bright lights.

608
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:08,575
<i>I was having a hard time</i>

609
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:11,056
<i>knowing the difference
between what was real or not.</i>

610
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,274
<i>Oh, please.</i>

611
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:14,624
You did it on live TV, pal.

612
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,061
Doesn't get any more real
than that.

613
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:19,281
Paddy, all I remember
from that night

614
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:21,457
is I was gonna kill myself.

615
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,155
On television.

616
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:26,854
I thought Murray
was playing a part in my show.

617
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:29,596
But he was a bad actor.

618
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,990
So he got what he deserved.

619
00:45:32,468 --> 00:45:34,862
Your last joke,
if we can call it a joke,

620
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:36,646
"You get
what you bleeping deserve."

621
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:37,952
That's what you said.

622
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:40,563
That's not fun,
that's not funny.

623
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,697
You're right, I...
I should have told a better one.

624
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:46,918
You're trying to be funny now?

625
00:45:47,657 --> 00:45:48,441
No.

626
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:53,881
Do you deserve to die?

627
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:56,057
The DA is calling
for the death penalty.

628
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:58,407
You just said that you wanted
to kill yourself on TV.

629
00:45:58,581 --> 00:45:59,539
So, tell us...

630
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,760
...you still wanna die?

631
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:07,460
Well, at the time, it certainly
seemed a lot easier than living.

632
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:11,290
Um, but that's...
that's not me anymore.

633
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:12,465
That's not...

634
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:14,728
That's not who I am.

635
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,121
That wasn't really you.

636
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:17,165
No, that's not right.

637
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:18,819
Let me get this straight.

638
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:20,690
- That's not what I meant.
- So your defense is,

639
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:22,649
"It was The Joker who did it."

640
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,433
- An insanity defense.
- Okay, I don't--

641
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:25,826
I don't know about a defense.

642
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,263
That this alternate personality,

643
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:31,614
this killer clown in you
killed Murray.

644
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,487
Who am I speaking to now?
Which one of you is here?

645
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:37,577
The poor, low IQ Arthur Fleck?

646
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,884
Or The Joker, who goaded
a bunch of no-good punks--

647
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:41,711
Do you really care?

648
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:43,713
You don't.

649
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:46,412
You're just like Murray.

650
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:48,936
You're just like everyone.
You want sensationalism.

651
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,416
You don't care about...

652
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,461
You just wanna talk
about my mistakes.

653
00:46:52,635 --> 00:46:53,941
You wanna talk about the things
that I did in the past.

654
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:55,377
Not about who I am now.

655
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:57,640
Not how I'm different now.

656
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:02,428
That's what we should be
talking about, Paddy.

657
00:47:04,038 --> 00:47:05,605
Okay, okay.

658
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,651
- We should take a break.
- We're not taking a break.

659
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,870
<i>All right.</i>

660
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:16,790
Okay, so, tell us...
what's changed, Arthur?

661
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,489
Well, I'll tell you
what's changed, Paddy.

662
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:23,753
I'm not alone anymore.

663
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,626
Right.

664
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,282
The girl who was singing.
The night you tried to escape.

665
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:32,458
We weren't trying to escape.

666
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:33,807
Miss Harley Quinzel.

667
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:38,333
You two put on
quite a performance that night.

668
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:39,639
Aww...

669
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:43,861
She's really something,
isn't she?

670
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:46,211
You tell me.

671
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,561
I mean,
don't you think it's all...

672
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:52,608
...don't you think
it's a little too much?

673
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:55,916
A little much?

<i>police will be on high alert,

709

710
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:18,205

Yeah, Arthur.

00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:35,097
This court is now in session.

00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,491
The Honorable Judge
Herman Rothwax is presiding.

747
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:42,975
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

748
00:54:44,063 --> 00:54:45,194
Please be seated.

749
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:49,938
William,
please invite the jury in.

750
00:54:59,078 --> 00:55:00,688
Are you all right, Mr. Fleck?

751
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:04,301
Everything okay?

752
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:08,435
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm just looking for someone.

753
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,310
Please, Mr. Fleck, sit down.

754
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:19,011
I realize
there's a lot going on.

755
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:21,796
But this is still
a court of law.

756
00:55:22,188 --> 00:55:25,060
Any and all outbursts
will not be tolerated.

757
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:27,846
And that applies
to everyone in this courtroom.

775
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:50,668
It's my view that there is
absolutely no evidence

776
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:54,367
that Arthur Fleck suffers from
multiple personality disorder.

777
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:58,980
Or that he ever behaved
in the role of "Joker,"

778
00:56:59,154 --> 00:57:04,072
as a separate personality
dissociated from himself.

779
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:06,814
Doctor, in your opinion,

780
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:09,600
concerning the work
you did on this case,

781
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:14,735
do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers
from a mental disease or defect?

782
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:17,477
No. In my opinion,

783
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:22,482
he's not psychotic
or unable to test reality.

784
00:57:22,656 --> 00:57:25,572
I think he was sane
when he committed these crimes.

785
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:29,968
In fact, I believe he fakes
his mental illness.

786
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:33,188
Quiet.

787
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:38,933
And... if he's, uh...

788
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,502
...faking it, as you say,

789
00:57:43,634 --> 00:57:45,026
then what is your opinion

790
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,508
on the defendant's
mental condition?

791
00:57:48,682 --> 00:57:51,163
I believe he has
four relatively minor

792
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:54,035
and quite common
mental disorders

793
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:57,778
that involve
long-standing sadness,

794
00:57:57,952 --> 00:58:02,043
narcissistic self-centeredness,
friendlessness,

795
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:04,785
an indifference
to the feelings of others.

796
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:07,440
This is
a very disturbed individual.

797
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:12,576
But I can't give you any kind
of psychiatric defense for him.

798
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:14,621
Thank you, Doctor Liu.

799
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:17,494
Nothing further, Your Honor.

800
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,106
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

801
00:58:21,846 --> 00:58:22,542
Thank you.

802
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:27,852
Doctor Liu, good morning.

803
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:29,027
Morning.

804
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:32,509
How long did you interview
Arthur Fleck for?

805
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:34,075
About two hours.

806
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:35,642
About two hours.

807
00:58:36,904 --> 00:58:38,602
It was actually 89 minutes.

808
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:42,823
Tell me,
how can you say for certain,

809
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:45,217
that Arthur isn't mentally ill?

810
00:58:46,044 --> 00:58:49,177
How can you be so sure
after just 89 minutes,

811
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:51,702
that this "Joker"

812
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:55,923
isn't a distinctly separate
and split personality from him?

813
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:58,404
That that's not who he is.

814
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:01,842
Well, I also reviewed
all the test results.

815
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:06,673
Psychological tests,
neurological and medical tests.

816
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:09,807
And in my view,
it's just a performance.

817
00:59:11,373 --> 00:59:12,549
Did you read the records

818
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:14,812
from the
Department of Social Services...

819
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:19,817
...that show that when Arthur
was seven years old,

820
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,993
they returned him
to his abuser's home?

821
00:59:24,038 --> 00:59:26,258
His mother's home.

822
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:28,434
I did, yes.

823
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,525
And when you
interviewed him for 89 minutes,

824
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:36,137
did you ask him
why Social Services

825
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:38,705
didn't believe
the horrific stories

826
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,752
a seven-year-old boy told them

827
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:44,581
about the physical
and sexual abuse he suffered?

828
00:59:49,194 --> 00:59:52,110
No, I...
I didn't ask him about that.

829
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:53,938
Hmm.

830
00:59:54,112 --> 00:59:56,897
So you want us to believe,

831
00:59:57,942 --> 01:00:03,121
that after spending just
89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,

832
01:00:03,295 --> 01:00:07,386
and reading through
his records and tests

833
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,955
from the same government
agencies that abandoned him,

834
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:12,783
you want us to believe

835
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:16,351
that you can say
with absolute certainty

836
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:21,008
that Arthur doesn't suffer
from any serious mental illness?

837
01:00:22,009 --> 01:00:25,186
That he didn't need
to retreat into fantasy

838
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,841
and create another identity

839
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:33,978
to protect that scared,
vulnerable, seven-year-old boy

840
01:00:34,152 --> 01:00:37,111
from all the trauma and abuse
he suffered?

841
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:41,725
And that that identity
didn't come out again,

842
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:44,858
when he was
attacked and tormented

843
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:48,296
by three drunk bullies
on the subway?

844
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,520
<i>"After I woke up this morning,</i>

845
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,871
<i>I thought,
'Murray, Murray, Murray.'</i>

846
01:00:58,045 --> 01:01:00,613
And then there's Murray.

847
01:01:00,918 --> 01:01:02,049
Funny, right?

848
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:04,748
Then I remember Sophie.

849
01:01:04,922 --> 01:01:07,272
- I had anoth--"
- Objection. Your Honor...

850
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:10,188
Again, my client's
personal diary is privileged.

851
01:01:10,362 --> 01:01:11,885
Overruled.

852
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,758
Again, as long as Mrs. Kane
limits her comments

853
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:16,324
to Mr. Fleck's journals--

854
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:17,935
But these are my own
personal private jokes.

855
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:19,240
They weren't meant
to be read out loud.

856
01:01:19,414 --> 01:01:20,720
Mr. Fleck. Quiet!

857
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:25,159
These are your words
she's reading.

858
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,552
And it's up to the jury

859
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:28,162
to determine
what to make of them.

860
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:32,079
Please proceed.

861
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,604
Ms. Kane,
please continue reading

862
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:38,303
from the, uh...
the highlighted portion.

863
01:01:39,434 --> 01:01:41,436
"Then I remember Sophie.

864
01:01:42,002 --> 01:01:44,265
Had another dream about her.
Forgot it.

865
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:47,573
<i>I almost never dream.</i>

866
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:50,097
What do I gotta do to remember?"

867
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:52,578
That's Sophie Dumond,
Mr. Fleck's neighbor,

868
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:54,798
whom he was obsessed with.

869
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:55,712
What was that date?

870
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:58,279
November 17.

871
01:01:59,628 --> 01:02:01,718
Let the record show,

872
01:02:01,892 --> 01:02:04,851
November 17th
is the day that Mr. Fleck

873
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:07,724
stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death.

874
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:14,687
The very same day that he shot
and killed Murray Franklin.

875
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:19,736
Now, I know it's not
your area of expertise,

876
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,172
but you have read all of

877
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:23,087
Mr. Fleck's journal before, correct?

878
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:24,479
Yes, I have.

879
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:27,308
And in your opinion,

880
01:02:27,482 --> 01:02:30,877
does this sound
like a different voice?

881
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:36,317
Like a different, uh...
personality wrote this?

882
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:39,581
No, it sounds like Arthur.

883
01:02:40,495 --> 01:02:42,149
Go on.

884
01:02:42,323 --> 01:02:45,239
He often wrote about
his fantasies.

885
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:52,159
And... the... women he had
imaginary relationships with.

886
01:02:53,552 --> 01:02:56,555
<i>And of course, his jokes.</i>

887
01:02:56,729 --> 01:03:00,820
<i>There were always
a lot of... these...</i>

888
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:03,127
<i>these unfunny jokes.</i>

889
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:06,695
She's just a social worker.

890
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,697
I don't think
she's even qualified--

891
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:10,438
You know, you're making him out
to be a fucking idiot in there.

892
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:14,312
He's never gonna get out
if you keep this shit up.

893
01:03:14,486 --> 01:03:16,880
Ask her why she has me
sitting so far away from him.

894
01:03:17,663 --> 01:03:19,273
Let's not do this here. Please?

895
01:03:19,447 --> 01:03:21,145
Do you see
all those people out front?

896
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:22,842
Who do you think
they're here for?

897
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:24,844
How many T-shirts
is Arthur Fleck on?

898
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:27,629
How many signs?

899
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,196
It's the Trial of the Century

900
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,633
and she doesn't even know
who her own client is.

901
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,114
- What do you mean by that?
- Can't you see how sick he is?

902
01:03:34,288 --> 01:03:36,116
How much help he needs?

903
01:03:36,856 --> 01:03:38,336
He's not sick.

904
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,426
He's perfect.

905
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,862
You don't really think
he's just gonna

906
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:44,908
walk out of here, do you?

907
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:46,997
Yeah, he's gonna walk
right outta here.

908
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:49,913
- With me by his side.
-  And then what?

909
01:03:51,305 --> 01:03:53,177
Any further statements?

910
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:55,179
And then we're gonna
build a mountain.

911
01:03:55,353 --> 01:03:57,659
-  A what?
- From a little hill.

912
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,401
What does that even mean?

913
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:01,881
- Are you going to get married?
- Move!

914
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:05,842
You're not listening.

915
01:04:06,016 --> 01:04:08,061
We can win this case,
and she's gonna fuck it all up.

916
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:10,498
No, you're not listening.

917
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:12,196
Lee's looking out for me.

918
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:16,504
She understands
what I've been through.

919
01:04:16,678 --> 01:04:18,289
What are you talking about?

920
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,161
We're from
the same neighborhood.

921
01:04:21,335 --> 01:04:25,383
She lost her father. You know...
her mom was awful to her.

922
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:26,906
She had her committed.

923
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,474
So just give her a break.

924
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,304
Okay, Lee cares about you, sure.

925
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:34,958
I know.

926
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:37,569
But she didn't grow up
in your neighborhood.

927
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:40,702
She lives on the Upper West Side
with her parents.

928
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,923
Her father is not dead,
he's a doctor.

929
01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:46,273
She voluntarily
committed herself

930
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:47,666
to the hospital,

931
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,320
and then just
checked herself out

932
01:04:49,494 --> 01:04:50,538
when she wanted to.

933
01:04:50,712 --> 01:04:52,323
She didn't check herself out.

934
01:04:52,497 --> 01:04:54,151
Arthur.

935
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:56,718
I was a bad influence on her,
so they separated us.

936
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:02,507
Did she mention she went
to grad school for psychiatry?

937
01:05:02,681 --> 01:05:05,684
You wouldn't get it.

938
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:10,123
My point is she's playing you
for a fool.

939
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:13,213
I'm sorry, I just--

940
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:17,174
I know what it's like
to love somebody.

941
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:19,785
But I don't think you can
believe a word she says.

Well, you weren't even looking
at me anymore.

966
01:07:02,975 --> 01:07:04,237
You were making it
all about yourself.

967
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:06,761
And the song...

968
01:07:06,935 --> 01:07:09,155
is about loving me!

969
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:13,333
Now look who's making it
all about themselves.

970
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:14,900
Oh...

971
01:07:15,379 --> 01:07:17,076
So you're saying
it's not about us?

972
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:20,645
It is, but we're singing
for them.

973
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:22,821
That's why we're here, honey.

974
01:07:22,995 --> 01:07:26,129
Oh! 'Cause I got
this sneaking suspicion

975
01:07:26,303 --> 01:07:28,653
that we're not giving the people
what they want.

976
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:30,959
It's okay baby, you're right.

977
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,572
Let's give the people
what they want.

978
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:39,011
Music.
Let's take it from the top.

979
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:48,064
Is the honeymoon over?

980
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:57,073
What?

981
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:01,947
Why'd you-- Why'd you do that?

982
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:12,653
Pew!

983
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:14,916
Pew!

984
01:08:16,483 --> 01:08:17,919
-  Get Healey.
- Pew!

985
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,010
Ba-room!

986
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,627
Well, look at you.

987
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:33,152
Couple of weeks back on TV
and already acting
like you own the joint.

988
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:35,589
What the fuck are you two doing
sitting on our bleachers?

989
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:37,504
Who said they're your bleachers?

990
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:40,116
Ricky, what the fuck
has gotten into you?

991
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:42,814
You heard me. Up.

992
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:45,121
Guess who I just saw out front?

993
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:48,211
Your little lady friend.

994
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:51,823
All right, enough.
Get up, both of you.

995
01:08:51,997 --> 01:08:54,130
Hey, Fleck, you got a visitor.

996
01:08:57,568 --> 01:08:59,222
See, Arthur? What'd I tell ya?

997
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:02,312
Move it!

998
01:09:05,576 --> 01:09:06,794
Every day, this asshole.

999
01:09:14,585 --> 01:09:16,717
You're a real
fucking whack job, Fleck.

1000
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:20,591
Uh-uh!

1001
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:36,041
Hey.

1002
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,260
Five minutes.

1003
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:43,614
How are you holding up?

1004
01:09:55,539 --> 01:09:57,236
Is everything okay?

1005
01:10:04,112 --> 01:10:06,202
Did you-- Did you lie to me?

1006
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:11,772
Sure.

1007
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:14,297
I mean, everybody lies a little.

1008
01:10:18,736 --> 01:10:21,434
And you're not from
the same neighborhood as me?

1009
01:10:21,608 --> 01:10:23,697
And your...
your dad's a doctor?

1010
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:25,960
You're rich?

1011
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,008
I just wanted you to like me.

1012
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:38,538
Did you really
check yourself in here?

1013
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:41,454
Yeah.

1014
01:10:45,937 --> 01:10:47,460
That's crazy.

1015
01:10:50,028 --> 01:10:53,553
Just... because you wanted
to meet me?

1016
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,816
Just to meet you.

1017
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:02,606
You could have just
wrote me a letter.

1018
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,306
And said what? I'm nobody.

1019
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:10,353
I haven't done anything
with my life like you have.

1020
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,749
Did you really watch
that TV movie

1021
01:11:15,923 --> 01:11:17,882
they made about me 20 times?

1022
01:11:18,056 --> 01:11:20,754
Um... probably more like
four or five.

1023
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,979
Was it actually good,
or did you lie about that too?

1024
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:29,850
It was great.

1025
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:41,688
My lawyer... says you're
playing me for a fool.

1026
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:44,648
I'm no fool.

1027
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:48,521
Can't you see what she's doing?

1028
01:11:49,174 --> 01:11:50,828
They're laughing at you
in there.

1029
01:11:53,613 --> 01:11:55,572
She doesn't care about you.

1030
01:11:57,617 --> 01:11:58,836
I do.

1031
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,623
Do you know I moved
into your old apartment building

1032
01:12:03,797 --> 01:12:06,496
to make us a home
for when you get out?

1033
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,802
Did your lawyer tell you that?

1034
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:12,153
You did?

1035
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,112
I don't want to live there.

1036
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,118
I'm pregnant.

1037
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:26,646

Did you think
he was gonna hurt you?

1065
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,933
Or your daughter?

1066
01:15:04,021 --> 01:15:05,501
I did, yes.

1067
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:09,940
You believed he was dangerous.

1068
01:15:12,116 --> 01:15:13,944
Well,
he broke into my apartment.

1069
01:15:15,815 --> 01:15:17,077
You call the police?

1070
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:19,515
No.

1071
01:15:21,473 --> 01:15:24,128
His mother told me, uh...

1072
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:26,783
that he'd had problems
his whole life, but that he...

1073
01:15:26,957 --> 01:15:28,611
wouldn't hurt a fly.

1074
01:15:31,483 --> 01:15:32,745
And...

1075
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:38,577
...was the man who broke
into your apartment that night,

1076
01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:44,365
was he different in any way
from the Arthur Fleck you knew?

1077
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:47,543
I didn't really know him.

1078
01:15:48,369 --> 01:15:51,895
I saw him in the lobby,
the elevator a few times.

1079
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,028
Like I said,
I knew his mother a little bit.

1080
01:15:55,202 --> 01:15:57,465
She was really sweet
to my daughter.

1081
01:15:58,771 --> 01:16:00,338
And Ms. Dumond,

1082
01:16:00,773 --> 01:16:03,820
why is it that you didn't want
to come here and testify today?

1083
01:16:04,864 --> 01:16:08,172
And why did you initially
ignore our subpoenas?

1084
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:12,089
Well,
after Arthur did what he did,

1085
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,527
the press wanted
to talk to me about it.

1086
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:18,356
And then I was a character

1087
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:21,489
in that awful TV movie
they made, and...

1088
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:23,013
-  It was awful?
- Then all these people...

1089
01:16:23,187 --> 01:16:24,667
No.

1090
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:27,191
...supporters, I guess,
like the people outside,

1091
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:31,499
started showing up
at my work and harassing me,

1092
01:16:31,891 --> 01:16:33,676
blaming me for what happened
to Arthur.

1093
01:16:35,982 --> 01:16:38,376
So I was afraid for my safety
and for my daughter's safety.

1094
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:39,943
We moved out of the city.

1095
01:16:40,508 --> 01:16:43,816
Well, then why did you
finally decide to comply?

1096
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:45,731
Because I should have
called the police that night.

1097
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:49,996
Then maybe all those people
wouldn't have been...

1098
01:16:52,259 --> 01:16:54,044
Maybe they wouldn't be
dead now if I did.

1099
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:58,396
Thank you. No more questions.

1100
01:16:59,963 --> 01:17:01,704
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

1101
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:05,490
Ms. Dumond.

1102
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:09,929
What happened
after you asked Arthur

1103
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:12,323
to leave your apartment
that night?

1104
01:17:12,497 --> 01:17:16,327
He told me he was having
a bad day. And then he left.

1105
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:18,895
So, he never hurt
or even threatened

1106
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:20,548
you or your daughter?

1107
01:17:22,289 --> 01:17:23,595
No.

1108
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,555
And did you watch him on TV
on <i>Murray Franklin</i>
the following week?

1109
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:29,514
I did.

1110
01:17:29,993 --> 01:17:32,299
And did that seem
like the same man

1111
01:17:32,473 --> 01:17:34,562
who was sitting
in your apartment that night?

1112
01:17:35,215 --> 01:17:38,958
Did he sound the same
or even look the same?

1113
01:17:39,524 --> 01:17:42,048
No, I mean, he was...
he was wearing clown make-up.

1114
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:46,357
And while Arthur's mother

1115
01:17:46,531 --> 01:17:49,621
was being so sweet
to your daughter,

1116
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:51,710
what was she telling you
about her own son?

1117
01:17:56,062 --> 01:17:57,455
Um...

1118
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,807
She told me that there was
something wrong with Arthur,

1119
01:18:01,981 --> 01:18:04,375
and that he lived
in a fantasy world

1120
01:18:04,549 --> 01:18:07,465
and that he had this laugh.

1121
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:09,772
She told you
it was a "dumb laugh."

1122
01:18:09,946 --> 01:18:12,035
<i>That's what she called it.</i>

1123
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:14,167
<i>"His dumb laugh."</i>

1124
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:15,908
Yes.

1125
01:18:16,866 --> 01:18:18,215
What else did she tell you?

1126
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:24,525
That she made up a story,
when he was a kid.

1127
01:18:25,526 --> 01:18:27,615
So that he would feel
better about it.

1128
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:29,008
So that he would stop crying,

1129
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:31,010
so that he wouldn't
kill himself.

1130
01:18:31,968 --> 01:18:33,404
What was the story?

1131
01:18:34,187 --> 01:18:37,060
That he was put
on this earth to bring joy.

1132
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,672
Something like that.
It's why she called him "Happy."

1133
01:18:41,499 --> 01:18:42,282
And?

1134
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:45,024
And she...

1135
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:47,070
couldn't believe that
he based his whole life

1136
01:18:47,244 --> 01:18:49,159
around this made-up story.

1137
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:52,205
He was a street clown,
and he wanted to be a comedian.

1138
01:18:54,251 --> 01:18:57,167
She made fun of him
for doing that?

1139
01:18:57,341 --> 01:18:59,082
She just thought
it was ridiculous

1140
01:18:59,256 --> 01:19:00,605
that he thought
he could make people laugh.

1141
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:02,607
I mean, she said Arthur
wasn't funny at all.

1142
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:06,567
<i>Did she tell you
that he had been</i>

1143
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,395
<i>in and out of institutions
his whole life?</i>

1144
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:10,658
<i>Yes.</i>

1145
01:19:11,964 --> 01:19:13,705

That he had never had
a girlfriend

1177
01:22:10,186 --> 01:22:12,753
and she thought
he was probably a virgin.

1178
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,320
I can't do this.

1179
01:22:15,017 --> 01:22:17,497
Oh! I can't do this anymore!

1180
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:19,238
<i>Your Honor, may I approach
the bench, please?</i>

1181
01:22:19,412 --> 01:22:20,457
<i>No, you may not.</i>

1182
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:21,937
<i>I want to fire my lawyer.</i>

1183
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:22,676
<i>It's about time!</i>

1184
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,287
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1185
01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:25,375
I'd like to represent myself.

1186
01:22:25,549 --> 01:22:26,811
You're fired.

1187
01:22:26,985 --> 01:22:29,596
Arthur, don't do this.
This is real.

1188
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:31,337
You'd better believe it's real.

1189
01:22:31,511 --> 01:22:33,470
I want order in my court. Order!

1190
01:22:35,211 --> 01:22:38,605
Bailiff! Take Mr. Fleck
to his holding cell!

1191
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:41,565
<i>Order!</i>

1192
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:47,527
<i>I want to see all counsel
in my chambers immediately!</i>

1193
01:22:57,015 --> 01:22:59,148
This way? Thank you.

1194
01:23:03,935 --> 01:23:05,371
Hey, no touching.

1195
01:23:06,894 --> 01:23:08,896
I'm so fucking proud of you.

1196
01:23:14,859 --> 01:23:18,732
You should see it out there.
They're all going crazy for you.

1197
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:22,910
You did it.

1198
01:23:26,436 --> 01:23:30,005
I know, but maybe I should read
a law book or something.

1199
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:33,921
You know I never went
to high school?

1200
01:23:37,273 --> 01:23:38,622
I said, no touching.

1201
01:23:44,889 --> 01:23:46,804
You can do anything you want.

1202
01:23:48,806 --> 01:23:50,025
You're Joker.

1203
01:24:14,658 --> 01:24:16,877
<i>Good evening,
it's 48 degrees at 6:00</i>

1204
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,792
<i>on this Wednesday,
November 8th.</i>

1205
01:24:18,966 --> 01:24:21,491
<i>I'm Stan L. Brooks
and here's what's happening.</i>

1206
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:22,927
<i>Shocking developments
at the trial</i>

1207
01:24:23,101 --> 01:24:25,364
<i>of Arthur Fleck downtown today.</i>

1208
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:28,237
<i>Fleck, the accused killer,
also known as Joker,</i>

1209
01:24:28,411 --> 01:24:30,108
<i>interrupted testimony</i>

1210
01:24:30,282 --> 01:24:33,024
<i>and fired his lawyer
Maryanne Stewart in open court.</i>

1211
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:35,200
<i>Then he kissed her goodbye.</i>

1212
01:24:35,374 --> 01:24:37,072
<i>Afterwards, Fleck
was extensively questioned</i>

1213
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:39,422
<i>by Judge Herman Rothwax.</i>

1214
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:41,946
<i>The right
of self-representation</i>

1215
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:45,515
<i>is not a license to abuse
the dignity of the courtroom.</i>

1216
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:47,995
<i>Can you control your emotions,
Mr. Fleck?</i>

1217
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:49,432
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1218
01:24:49,606 --> 01:24:51,173
<i>Judge Rothwax reluctantly</i>

1219

<i>approved Fleck's request
to represent himself,</i>

1220
01:24:53,871 --> 01:24:56,439
<i>as long as he agreed
to stand-by counsel.</i>

1221
01:24:56,613 --> 01:24:58,615
<i>A decision that both Fleck's

<i>Maryanne Stewart
and Assistant DA, Harvey Dent</i>

1223

<i>disagree with.</i>

1224
01:25:03,054 --> 01:25:05,143
<i>It's really tragic.</i>

1225
01:25:05,317 --> 01:25:07,711
<i>Arthur believes he has
all of these supporters,</i>

1226
01:25:07,885 --> 01:25:09,974
<i>but they don't care about him.</i>

1227
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:12,237
<i>They care about Joker.</i>

1228
01:25:12,716 --> 01:25:14,848
<i>He's not dealing with reality.</i>

1229
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:17,242
<i>He's mentally ill.</i>

1230
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:18,896
<i>If we could have
just convinced him of that</i>

1231
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:20,593
<i>then we would have won
this case.</i>

1232
01:25:20,767 --> 01:25:22,247
<i>Fleck knows what he's doing.</i>

1233
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:23,944
<i>He knows he's losing.</i>

1234
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,512
<i>We cannot forget
that he's evil.</i>

1235
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:29,211
<i>This is all just
part of his plan.</i>

1236

All right, calm down, everybody.

01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,790

- Fleck, get off. Arthur!
-  Yeah, Arthur!

1243
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,622

1265
01:26:59,431 --> 01:27:03,043
After reviewing all the case law
that offers precedent,

1266
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:06,221
<i>Jensen v. Superior Court</i>
being the most relevant,

1267
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:09,180
I have reluctantly decided

1268
01:27:09,354 --> 01:27:12,183
that Mr. Fleck
does have the right

1269
01:27:12,357 --> 01:27:15,447
as an attorney,
to dress himself how he likes...

1270
01:27:17,014 --> 01:27:18,537
...as long as he doesn't
cause disorder

1271
01:27:18,711 --> 01:27:21,801
or interfere with
the functioning of the Court.

1272
01:27:22,759 --> 01:27:24,543
<i>I will not allow
this proceeding</i>

1273
01:27:24,717 --> 01:27:27,067

1274
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,634
<i>And I will not let you</i>

1275
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:30,984
<i>turn this into
any more of a circus</i>

1276
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:32,377
<i>than you already have.</i>

1277
01:27:32,551 --> 01:27:34,684
Thank you.

1278
01:27:34,858 --> 01:27:37,643
Mr. Dent,
call your next witness.

1279
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:44,041
The State calls Gary Puddles.

1280
01:27:44,737 --> 01:27:46,173
Bailiff?

1281
01:27:46,348 --> 01:27:48,175
Will you please escort
Mr. Puddles to the stand?

1282
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:10,372
Gary.

1283
01:28:13,897 --> 01:28:15,507
Go get 'em.

1284
01:28:42,404 --> 01:28:43,579
Please raise your right hand.

1285
01:28:46,408 --> 01:28:47,800
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony

1286
01:28:47,974 --> 01:28:49,585
you're about to give
is the whole truth

1287
01:28:49,759 --> 01:28:52,152
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1288
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,371
I do.

1289
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:58,768
Good morning, Mr. Puddles.

1290
01:28:58,942 --> 01:29:00,596
Thank you for being here.

1291
01:29:05,209 --> 01:29:06,689
So one last question, sir.

1292
01:29:06,863 --> 01:29:09,518
The person who you saw

1293
01:29:09,692 --> 01:29:11,824
stab Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death,

1294
01:29:13,783 --> 01:29:15,306
are they in this courtroom
here today?

1295
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,612
Yes.

1296
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,092
Can you point him out
to all of us?

1297
01:29:19,528 --> 01:29:23,227
And... describe his clothing?

1298
01:29:25,142 --> 01:29:27,710
He's... He's sitting right there
at the table.

1299
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:31,235
Wearing a red suit
and clown make-up.

1300
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,977
May the record reflect

1301
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:36,545
the identification
of the accused, Your Honor?

1302
01:29:37,197 --> 01:29:38,068
Yes, it will.

1303
01:29:39,286 --> 01:29:40,462
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1304
01:29:43,726 --> 01:29:45,380
Your witness, Mr. Fleck.

1305
01:29:54,258 --> 01:29:56,478
Mr. Puddles.

1306
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,830
Gary Puddles?

1307
01:30:02,658 --> 01:30:06,052
Tell me, sir,
is that your God-given name?

1308
01:30:07,706 --> 01:30:08,490
Yes.

1309
01:30:09,186 --> 01:30:10,448
Really?

1310
01:30:11,188 --> 01:30:14,147
Really?
Your last name is Puddles?

1311
01:30:16,802 --> 01:30:20,458
Why, it sounds like a... a joke.

1312
01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:21,981
Well, it's not.

1313
01:30:24,244 --> 01:30:26,943
You expect us to believe
that your last name is Puddles?

1314
01:30:27,117 --> 01:30:28,379
Puddles?

1315
01:30:28,553 --> 01:30:31,251
Mr. Fleck, where is this going?

1316
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:35,168
As I said, I'm not gonna let you
turn my courtroom into a circus.

1317
01:30:35,342 --> 01:30:36,779
Okay.

1318
01:30:36,953 --> 01:30:39,912
But, um, with all due respect,
Your Honor,

1319
01:30:40,086 --> 01:30:42,132
don't you think
it's a little late for that?

1320
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:43,873
- Don't try my patience.
-  Okay. Okay.

1321
01:30:47,006 --> 01:30:49,574
Mr. Puddles...

1322
01:30:50,532 --> 01:30:53,535
earlier this afternoon
you testified

1323
01:30:53,709 --> 01:30:56,799
that you saw me stab
Mr. Kliman Manhoff

1324
01:30:56,973 --> 01:31:00,237
in the neck a couple of times.
Correct?

1325
01:31:01,107 --> 01:31:01,978
Kleinmanhoffer.

1326
01:31:02,935 --> 01:31:05,024
Yes, I saw you.

1327
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:06,635
Mm.

1328
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:10,073
And what else
did you see that day?

1329
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,512
You stabbing him in the eye,

1330
01:31:14,686 --> 01:31:17,080
and bashing his head
into the wall,

1331
01:31:17,254 --> 01:31:19,865
many, many times.

1332
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:24,783
Yes, but, uh, Randall
was a bit of a bully, wasn't he?

1333
01:31:25,915 --> 01:31:27,917
He didn't deserve to die.

1334
01:31:30,049 --> 01:31:31,834
I don't know.

1335
01:31:32,008 --> 01:31:33,313
Eh, never mind.

1336
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:36,229
Gary, did you catch my act

1337
01:31:36,403 --> 01:31:38,667
on <i>The Murray Franklin Show</i>
later that night?

1338
01:31:39,145 --> 01:31:40,364
No, I didn't.

1339
01:31:40,538 --> 01:31:41,626
No?

1340
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:46,065
Might I remind you
that you are under oath?

1341
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:48,111
I was locked up
at the police station.

1342
01:31:48,285 --> 01:31:49,852
In an interview room.

1343
01:31:50,853 --> 01:31:53,116
'Cause they thought
you might come and kill me.

1344
01:31:54,552 --> 01:31:55,727
I was the only witness.

1345
01:31:55,901 --> 01:31:57,686
They kept me in there all night.

1346
01:31:59,035 --> 01:32:02,168
Isn't that convenient,
Mr. Puddles?

1347
01:32:02,342 --> 01:32:05,084
That you didn't see the show,
you didn't see anything
I had to say,

1348
01:32:05,258 --> 01:32:06,651
I can't believe it!

1349
01:32:07,043 --> 01:32:08,000
Mr. Fleck.

1350
01:32:08,435 --> 01:32:09,872
Okay.

1351
01:32:11,787 --> 01:32:14,354
Uh, when you were
in my mama's apartment,

1352
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,400
God rest her soul,

1353
01:32:16,574 --> 01:32:20,752
when, as you say, you saw me
bash Mr. Klannonmen--

1354
01:32:20,926 --> 01:32:25,540
whatever's-- head into the wall,
"many, many times,"

1355
01:32:27,237 --> 01:32:28,804
did I seem crazy to you?

1356
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,939
Did I seem
like a different person?

1357
01:32:34,113 --> 01:32:40,772
Or was I the same old Joker
that I always been?

1358
01:32:42,426 --> 01:32:45,777
Arthur, don't do this
to yourself, it isn't you.

1359
01:32:46,212 --> 01:32:49,607
It isn't me?
So you don't think this is me?

1360
01:32:49,781 --> 01:32:53,437
Well, maybe... maybe...
you don't know who I really was.

1361
01:32:56,309 --> 01:32:57,789
I never saw that side of you.

1362
01:32:57,963 --> 01:32:59,530
Well, maybe you weren't looking.

1363
01:33:00,357 --> 01:33:01,924
Maybe no one was.

1364
01:33:02,098 --> 01:33:05,884
Because nobody knew I existed.

1365
01:33:06,058 --> 01:33:08,452
But look around,
look at all these people.

1366
01:33:08,626 --> 01:33:12,151
Everyone outside. These cameras.

1367
01:33:12,325 --> 01:33:15,328
Who do you think they see,
Mr. Puddles?

1368
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,157
Joker.

1369
01:33:20,943 --> 01:33:22,988
Oh, sweet child,

1370
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:28,907
what you have proven here today,
is that you are no different

1371
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:32,041
than any of those people
that underestimated me.

1372
01:33:32,215 --> 01:33:33,956
<i>From Murray Franklin,</i>

1373
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:38,482

stupid guards at Arkham.</i>

01:33:38,656 --> 01:33:40,832

they can treat me like trash.</i>

1375
01:33:41,006 --> 01:33:42,399

<i>or any of you to keep me down.</i>

01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:50,189
<i>I am free!</i>

1379
01:33:55,151 --> 01:33:56,848
Why are you doing this
to me, Arthur?

1380
01:33:57,544 --> 01:33:58,328
What?

1381
01:33:59,285 --> 01:34:00,722
Gary, I like you.

1382
01:34:01,461 --> 01:34:03,942
I told you I wouldn't hurt you,
and I didn't.

1383
01:34:04,116 --> 01:34:05,422
Not hurt me?

1384
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,339
I couldn't go back to work.

1385
01:34:10,209 --> 01:34:14,126
I still can't sleep,
and I'm scared all the time.

1386
01:34:15,345 --> 01:34:17,260
I never used to be scared.

1387
01:34:18,391 --> 01:34:21,960
I'm scared right now, here.
With you in front of me.

1388
01:34:24,354 --> 01:34:27,096
I couldn't do anything that day.

1389
01:34:27,966 --> 01:34:30,490
I felt so small.

1390
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,669
I was reminded
how powerless I really am.

1391
01:34:36,627 --> 01:34:39,499
Oh... you got
a flair for the dramatic.

1392
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:42,328
You are tugging at
my heart strings, little Gary.

1393
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,465
No more-- no more questions,
Your Honor.

1394
01:34:49,596 --> 01:34:52,034
Do you know
what that feels like, Arthur?

1395
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,905
Oh, fuck!

1396
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:58,083
You were the only one at work
who never made fun of me.

1397
01:34:58,997 --> 01:35:01,260
You were the only one
that was nice to me.

1398
01:35:04,133 --> 01:35:07,092
I said, no more questions,
Your Honor!

1399
01:35:11,488 --> 01:35:13,446
Very well, Mr. Puddles.

1400
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:15,448
The court thanks you
for your testimony.

1401
01:35:17,494 --> 01:35:19,583
Please step down,
you're excused.

1402
01:35:34,293 --> 01:35:35,947
Mr. Dent,
call your next witness.

1403
01:35:38,863 --> 01:35:40,691
We're not calling
any more witnesses, Your Honor.

1404
01:35:41,692 --> 01:35:43,520
That is the State's case.

1405
01:35:43,694 --> 01:35:44,782
The State rests.

1406
01:35:45,696 --> 01:35:46,610
Very well.

1407
01:35:47,829 --> 01:35:49,395
All right, Mr. Fleck,

1408
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:52,224
at this point,
you may mount your defense.

1409
01:35:55,924 --> 01:35:57,621
The defense rests as well,
Your Honor.

1410
01:35:59,188 --> 01:36:00,493
Pardon?

1411
01:36:01,451 --> 01:36:04,846
Mr. Fleck, you don't want
to put on any defense?

1412
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:07,892
No, Your Honor.
The defense rests.

1413
01:36:08,327 --> 01:36:10,547
"Th-Th-Th-That's all folks."

1414
01:36:10,721 --> 01:36:12,592
All right, all right.

1415
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:15,204
All right.

1416
01:36:17,249 --> 01:36:19,425
<i>That's enough!
This is a court of law!</i>

1417
01:36:22,211 --> 01:36:24,343
<i>With both sides having rested,</i>

1418
01:36:25,388 --> 01:36:29,305
<i>this court will recess
until tomorrow morning at 9:30.</i>

1419
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:32,047
You made our case
for us, you fucking idiot!

1420
01:36:32,221 --> 01:36:33,526
You're gonna fry
for killing my son!

1421
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:35,006
Burn in hell!

1422
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,529
Anything you want to say?

1423
01:36:36,703 --> 01:36:37,879
Arthur, will you be convicted?

1424
01:36:38,053 --> 01:36:39,315
Arthur, over here.

1425
01:36:39,489 --> 01:36:40,707
Let's see that smile.

1426
01:36:40,882 --> 01:36:42,144
Where do you think you stand,
Arthur?

1427
01:36:45,974 --> 01:36:47,584
What are you
gonna do if they let you off?

I told him,
"I'm not dealing
with those days."

1479
01:40:15,052 --> 01:40:16,445
I'm only working
four of these days.

1480
01:40:17,489 --> 01:40:18,273
Good for you.

1481
01:40:52,481 --> 01:40:53,395
Joe, how goes it?

1482
01:40:53,569 --> 01:40:55,527
You know, same old bullshit.

1483
01:40:55,701 --> 01:40:56,615
Joker.

1484
01:40:56,789 --> 01:40:57,747
How's Kathy?

1485
01:40:57,921 --> 01:40:58,878
Is that really him?

1486
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:00,054
Still busting my balls.

1487
01:41:00,793 --> 01:41:01,403
Yeah, they always do.

1488
01:41:01,577 --> 01:41:02,360
Yep.

1489
01:41:06,147 --> 01:41:07,017
See you fellas in the morning.

1490
01:41:11,587 --> 01:41:12,544
Give 'em hell, man.

1491
01:41:13,371 --> 01:41:14,633
Uh-oh.

1492
01:41:15,547 --> 01:41:16,635
I'm in trouble.

1493
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,724
What?

1494
01:41:19,812 --> 01:41:20,857
Move.

1495
01:41:21,031 --> 01:41:22,163
Easy, darling.

1496
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:30,388
Why is everyone
so upset with me?

1497
01:41:30,562 --> 01:41:31,737
Move your ass.

1498
01:41:33,304 --> 01:41:34,349
Come on, Arthur.

1499
01:41:36,612 --> 01:41:38,440
I'm an attorney now!

1500
01:41:38,614 --> 01:41:40,485
- I will see you in court.
- Shut the fuck up.

1501
01:41:40,659 --> 01:41:42,052
And I'm the fucking
Queen of Sheba.

1502
01:41:42,226 --> 01:41:43,706
I'm gonna fucking murder you.

1503
01:41:46,448 --> 01:41:47,188
Yeah?

1504
01:41:48,363 --> 01:41:49,494
Get up!

1505
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,061
Grab his legs, Mac.

1506
01:41:52,932 --> 01:41:53,846
Let's go.

1507
01:41:55,674 --> 01:41:58,286
Had to go and be
a big shot on TV.

1508
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:59,722
I think he knocked himself out.

1509
01:42:03,204 --> 01:42:04,335
Motherfucker.

1510
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:07,991
Stand him up.

1511
01:42:12,474 --> 01:42:15,651
All right, I get it.
I get it, Jackie.

1512
01:42:16,042 --> 01:42:17,870
You wanna--
You wanna hear a joke, right?

1513
01:42:18,044 --> 01:42:19,611
You really think...

1514
01:42:19,785 --> 01:42:21,352
...fancy red suit

1515
01:42:21,526 --> 01:42:23,833
and muck on your face
makes you better than us?

1516
01:42:24,486 --> 01:42:27,315
You have no fucking idea
what it takes,

1517
01:42:27,489 --> 01:42:30,448
put a little bit of joy
into this fucking place.

1518
01:42:30,622 --> 01:42:33,103
Let me tell you one I used to do
about my mother.

1519
01:42:33,277 --> 01:42:34,539
You can drop the act now.

1520
01:42:34,713 --> 01:42:35,888
- My mother was...
- Because we know

1521
01:42:36,062 --> 01:42:37,934
it's only Arthur in there, okay?

1522
01:42:38,108 --> 01:42:40,371
And she only dated abusive guys.

1523
01:42:40,545 --> 01:42:41,459
Yeah, is that right?

1524
01:42:41,633 --> 01:42:43,766
And, I asked her, I said,

1525
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:47,900
"Mom, why do you stay
with your abusive boyfriend?"

1526
01:42:48,423 --> 01:42:49,815
And she said...

1527
01:42:49,989 --> 01:42:51,339
"Beats the hell out of me."

1528
01:42:53,079 --> 01:42:54,211
I told you to drop it.

1529
01:42:55,908 --> 01:42:57,258
Oh, he liked it!

1530
01:43:03,612 --> 01:43:05,309
Oh, Jackie...

1531
01:43:05,483 --> 01:43:07,181
aren't you gonna
buy me a drink first?

1532
01:43:09,313 --> 01:43:11,054
Let's go, let's go.

1533
01:43:11,228 --> 01:43:12,969
- Let's fucking go!
-  No!

1534
01:43:15,885 --> 01:43:18,801
- Get the fuck in there!
- No!

1535
01:43:19,497 --> 01:43:21,978
- Let go!
- Get that fucking jacket off.

1536
01:43:22,152 --> 01:43:23,675
Shut the fuck up.

1537
01:43:24,154 --> 01:43:25,373

1542
01:43:38,168 --> 01:43:39,169
What'd you do to him?

1543
01:43:39,343 --> 01:43:40,214
Shut the fuck up, Ricky!

1544
01:43:40,388 --> 01:43:41,606

1545
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:42,607

your closing statement.</i>

1586
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:37,668
A word of caution.
This is not a comedy club.

1587
01:47:37,842 --> 01:47:39,757
You are not onstage.

1588
01:48:01,997 --> 01:48:03,477
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1589
01:48:06,001 --> 01:48:07,916
Do you need a short recess, sir?

1590
01:48:26,978 --> 01:48:30,504
I... I wanted to come out here
as Joker.

1591
01:48:32,462 --> 01:48:37,162
And I was gonna go on a...
an angry rant.

1592
01:48:37,989 --> 01:48:39,164
And blame all of you,

1593
01:48:40,165 --> 01:48:41,253
and everyone...

1594
01:48:44,953 --> 01:48:47,956
...for this
fucking miserable life.

1595
01:48:50,567 --> 01:48:51,829
<i>But it wouldn't matter,</i>

1596
01:48:52,003 --> 01:48:53,352
<i>because I can't do this
anymore.</i>

1597
01:48:55,093 --> 01:48:57,052
<i>'Cause I can't be
who you want me to be.</i>

1598
01:48:59,097 --> 01:49:00,708
<i>It was all just a fantasy.</i>

1599
01:49:11,196 --> 01:49:12,720
There is no Joker.

1600
01:49:14,722 --> 01:49:15,853
It's just me.

1601
01:49:24,645 --> 01:49:26,429
I-I killed six people.

1602
01:49:30,128 --> 01:49:32,914
I wish I didn't, but I did.

1603
01:49:35,917 --> 01:49:38,920
Nobody knows, but...
I also killed my mother.

1604
01:49:41,052 --> 01:49:46,492
Put a... pillow over her face,
and smothered her to death.

1605
01:49:53,282 --> 01:49:54,239
I just wanna...

1606
01:49:55,632 --> 01:49:57,634
I just wanna blow it all up,

1607
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:01,333
and start a new life.

1608
01:50:19,264 --> 01:50:20,570
Settle down.

1609
01:50:35,759 --> 01:50:37,631
Knock... knock.

1610
01:50:39,937 --> 01:50:40,895
Who's there?

1611
01:50:45,377 --> 01:50:46,552
Arthur Fleck.

1612
01:50:50,905 --> 01:50:52,733
Arthur Fleck who?

1613
01:51:03,091 --> 01:51:05,049
<i>Hey, it's Harley,

1617
01:51:12,796 --> 01:51:15,712
Hi, it's me. Arthur.

1618
01:51:18,541 --> 01:51:20,935
The jury has already
come back with a verdict.

1619
01:51:22,066 --> 01:51:23,459
Took 'em less than an hour.

1620
01:51:24,852 --> 01:51:27,028
So, you know.

1621
01:51:29,813 --> 01:51:31,641
But they let me call you
to see if you'd come back,

1622
01:51:31,815 --> 01:51:33,469

02:00:39,406 --> 02:00:41,625
Come back, man. Joker.

1735
02:00:44,411 --> 02:00:45,977
Fuck.

1736
02:00:46,151 --> 02:00:47,327
No!

1737
02:00:47,501 --> 02:00:48,850
Where are you going, man?

1738
02:00:49,416 --> 02:00:50,591
We still love you.

1739
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,593
We love you, Joker.

1740
02:00:52,984 --> 02:00:54,203
Joker!

1741
02:00:57,728 --> 02:00:59,208
Joker!

1742
02:01:31,501 --> 02:01:32,589
Lee?

1743
02:01:37,507 --> 02:01:38,378
Lee!

1744
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:05,579
Look at you.

1745
02:02:08,756 --> 02:02:09,844
You cut your hair.

1746
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:21,377
Someone blew up the courthouse,
and I'm free.

1747
02:02:24,685 --> 02:02:26,121
We can go away.

1748
02:02:32,693 --> 02:02:34,216
Lee, you hear me?

1749
02:02:35,086 --> 02:02:37,001
Someone blew up the courthouse.

1750
02:02:37,175 --> 02:02:38,133
We can go.

1751
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:41,484
I escaped.

1752
02:02:43,965 --> 02:02:45,662
We're not going away, Arthur.

1753
02:02:48,012 --> 02:02:51,059
All we had was the fantasy,
and you gave up.

1754
02:02:54,062 --> 02:02:55,542
We were never going anywhere.

1755
02:03:02,636 --> 02:03:04,377
I'm that same guy
you fell in love with.

1756
02:03:06,553 --> 02:03:09,382
I'm the same guy
that murdered Murray Franklin.

1757
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:11,384
No.

1758
02:03:13,037 --> 02:03:14,082
No, you're not.

1759
02:03:15,562 --> 02:03:17,259
There is no Joker.

1760
02:03:18,391 --> 02:03:19,783
That's what you said, isn't it?

1761
02:03:28,052 --> 02:03:29,837
I can't--

1762
02:03:30,490 --> 02:03:32,579
I can't--
I can't live without you.

1763
02:03:36,234 --> 02:03:38,759

No fucking cigarettes left.

02:06:12,042 --> 02:06:13,478
Let's go.

1789
02:06:19,528 --> 02:06:21,225
Hey, Arthur. Hold up.

1790
02:06:24,315 --> 02:06:25,752
Can I tell you a joke
I came up with?

1791
02:06:26,491 --> 02:06:27,797
Um...

1792
02:06:27,971 --> 02:06:29,277

Okay.

1795
02:06:33,237 --> 02:06:35,892
So, a psychopath walks
into a bar,

1796
02:06:36,066 --> 02:06:38,765
and sees this famous clown
sitting there all alone.

1797
02:06:39,243 --> 02:06:40,854
Totally drunk, it's pathetic.

1798
02:06:41,768 --> 02:06:43,944
"I can't believe you're here,"
he says.

1799
02:06:44,466 --> 02:06:49,123
"What a disappointment.
I used to watch you on TV.

1800
02:06:50,646 --> 02:06:52,343
What can I get you?"

1801
02:06:52,517 --> 02:06:54,781
And this clown turns and says,

1802
02:06:55,912 --> 02:06:58,785
"Well, if you're buying
you can get me anything."

1803
02:07:01,309 --> 02:07:03,616
"Perfect," the psychopath says.

1804
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:05,792
"How about I get you
what you fucking deserve?"

1805
02:07:34,647 --> 02:07:37,519
