2
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,913
Do you have any idea
what they were arguing about?

3
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,499
D-Do you speak English?

4
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:12,545
Yeah. No, I'm sorry.
My German is not very good.

5
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:21,346
Have you heard that as couples get older,
they lose their ability to hear each other?

6
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,973
No.

7
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:28,186
Well, supposedly, men lose their ability
to hear higher-pitched sounds.

8
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,230
And women eventually
lose hearing on the low end.

9
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:34,192
- I guess they sort of nullify each other.
- I guess.

10
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,987
Nature's way of allowing couples to grow
old together without killing each other.

11
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:42,283
What are you reading?

12
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,535
Ah, yeah.

13
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,122
- How about you?
- Um...

14
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,292
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

15
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,350
Look, I was thinking about going
to the lounge car sometime soon.

16
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,019
- Would you like to come with me?
- Yeah.

17
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:12,939
Okay.

18
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,460
So how do you speak such good English?

19
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:37,213
I went to school
for a summer in Los Angeles.

20
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,756
- Yeah?
- It's fine here?

21
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,550
Yeah, this is good.

22
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,760
Then I spent some time in London.

23
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,054
Uh, well...

24
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:47,348
How do you speak such good English?

25
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:49,142
Me? I'm American.

26
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,351
- You're American?
- Yeah.

27
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,228
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

28
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,273
No, I'm joking.

29
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:59,277
I knew you were American. And of course,
you don't speak any other language, right?

30
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:01,988
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it, I get it.

31
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,282
So I'm the crude, dumb, vulgar American

32
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,201
who doesn't speak any other languages,
who has no culture, right?

33
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,245
But I tried.

34
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,456
I took French for four years
in high school.

35
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:15,835
When I first got to Paris,
I stood in line at the Metro station,

36
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,463
I was practicing —
<i>Une billet, s'il vous plaît.</i>

37
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,840
<i>- Une billet, s'il vous plaît.
- Un billet.</i>

38
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,426
<i>Un,</i> whatever —<i>Un — Un —</i>

39
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,262
<i>Un billet, s'il vous plait.
Un billet, s'il vous plait.</i>

40
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:30,892
And I get up there and I look at this woman
and my mind goes completely blank.

41
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:34,520
And I start saying, "Ah, listen, I need
a ticket to get to, um —" You know.

42
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:37,273
So, anyway. Um —

43
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,400
So where are you headed?

44
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:43,571
Well, back to Paris.
My classes start next week.

45
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:47,492
- You're still in school? Where do you go?
- Yeah. La Sorbonne, you know?

46
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,202
Sure.

47
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:54,123
- Are you coming from Budapest?
- Yeah, I was visiting my grandmother.

48
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,500
Ah. How is she?

49
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,377
She — She's okay.

50
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,546
- She's all right?
- She's fine, yeah.

51
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:05,051
- How about you? Where are you going?
- I'm going to Vienna.

52
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,596
- Vienna? What's there?
- I have no idea. I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

53
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,723
- Ah. You're on holiday?
- Uh...

54
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,146
- Uh, I don't really know what I'm on.
- Okay.

55
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,025
I'm just traveling around. I've been riding
the trains the past two, three weeks.

56
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:24,654
Mm-hmm. You were visiting friends
or just on your own?

57
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:28,407
- Yeah. I had a friend in Madrid, but, um —
- Madrid? That's nice.

58
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:31,661
Yeah, I got one of those
Eurail passes, is what I did.

59
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,246
That's great.

60
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:37,667
So, has this trip around Europe
been good for you?

61
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,628
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, it's been, um — It sucked.

62
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,380
- You know?
- What?

63
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,507
No, it's — It isn't —

64
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,135
It's had its, um — Well, I'll tell you.

65
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,762
Sitting, you know, for weeks on end,
looking out the window

66
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:51,931
has actually been kinda great.

67
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,976
What do you mean?

68
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:58,062
Well, uh, you know, for inst —

69
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,857
You have ideas
that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

70
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,454
- What kind of ideas?
- You wanna hear one?

71
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,278
- Yeah, tell me.
- All right.

72
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:08,406
- Uh, I have this idea, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

73
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:12,034
For a television show. Some friends of mine
are these cable access producers.

74
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,453
Do you know what that is, cable acc...

75
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:19,250
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,
and they have to put it on. Right?

76
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,588
I have this idea for this show that would last
24 hours a day, for a year straight, right?

77
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:27,300
What you do is you get 365 people

78
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:29,594
from cities all over the world

79
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,597
to do these 24-hour documents of real time,

80
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,600
capturing life as it's lived.

81
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,978
You know, it would start
with a guy waking up in the morning

82
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,314
and, uh, you know, taking a long shower,

83
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:44,609
um, eating a little breakfast,
making a little coffee,

84
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,111
you know, and, uh, reading the paper.

85
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:49,530
Wait, wait, all those mundane, boring things

86
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:52,950
everybody has to do
every day of their fucking life?

87
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,952
I was gonna say
"the poetry of day-to-day life."

88
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,955
But you say it the way you say it,
I'll say it the way I say it.

89
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,958
- Who's gonna want to watch this?
- But think about it like this —

90
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:05,296
Why is it that a dog
sleeping in the sun is so beautiful?

91
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,089
You know? It is. It's beautiful.

92
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,967
But a guy standing at a bank machine,
trying to take some money out,

93
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,261
looks like a complete moron.

94
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:16,599
So it's like a <i>National Geographic</i> program,
but on people.

95
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,517
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

96
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,520
- What do you think?
- I can — I can see it —

97
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,856
Like 24 boring hours. Sorry.

98
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,276
And, like, a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after, no?

99
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,779
Yeah! You know —

100
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,632
- I mean, that would be a great episode.
- Yeah.

101
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:34,617
People would talk about that episode.

102
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,012
You and your friends
could do one in Paris if you wanted to.

103
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,829
Oh, sure.

104
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:43,793
The key — The thing that kinda
haunts me is, uh — is the distribution.

105
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,588
Getting these tapes from town to town,
city to city, so that it would play continuously.

106
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:51,968
'Cause it'd have to play all the time
or else it just wouldn't work.

107
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,637
Thank you.

108
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,515
Thanks.

109
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:01,435
You know what?
They're not service-oriented.

110
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,564
Just an observation about Europe.

111
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:17,827
My parents have never really spoken
of the possibility of my falling in love

112
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,080
or getting married or having children.

113
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,165
Even as a little girl,

114
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:27,920
they wanted me to think as a future career
as a, you know, interior designer

115
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:30,214
or lawyer or something like that.

116
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:35,094
I'd say to my Dad, "I want to be a writer,"
and he'd say, "Journalist."

117
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:39,890
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats
and he'd say, "Veterinarian."

118
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,727
I'd say I wanted to be an actress
and he'd say, "TV newscaster."

119
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,981
It was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition

120
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,276
into these practical,
moneymaking ventures.

121
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,944
Mmm.

122
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,323
I always had a pretty good
bullshit detector when I was a kid.

123
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,783
I always knew when they were
lying to me, you know?

124
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,577
By the time I was in high school,

125
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,205
I was dead set on listening to what
everybody thought I should be doing with my life

126
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,083
and just kinda... doing the opposite.

127
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,253
Nobody was ever mean about it.

128
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:14,717
It's just I could never get very excited
about other people's ambitions for my life.

129
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,136
Hmm. But you know what?

130
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,556
If your parents never really
fully contradict you about anything

131
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,642
- and are basically nice and supportive —
- Right.

132
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,355
it makes it even harder
to officially complain.

133
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:29,106
You know, even when they're wrong.

134
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,235
It's this passive-aggressive shit.
You know what I mean? It's...

135
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,570
I hate it.

136
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,655
I really hate it.

137
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:42,661
Well, you know, despite all that kind
of bullshit that comes along with it,

138
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:45,748
I remember childhood as this...

139
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,542
you know, this magical time.

140
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:49,877
I do.

141
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,839
I remember when, uh, my mother
first told me about death.

142
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:56,133
My great-grandmother had just died,

143
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,719
and my whole family
had just visited them in Florida.

144
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,888
I was about three,
three and a half years old.

145
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,683
Anyway, I was in the backyard, playing,

146
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,769
and my sister had just taught me

147
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,731
how to take the garden hose
and do it in such a way that,

148
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,901
uh, it sprayed into the sun
and it would make a rainbow.

149
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,986
Right?

150
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,030
So I was doing that,

151
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:21,117
and through the mist,
I could see my grandmother.

152
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,079
You know? And she was
just standing there, smiling at me.

153
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,499
And, uh, I held it there for a long time

154
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:33,546
and I looked at her,
and then finally I-I let go of the nozzle.

155
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,215
You know? And then I dropped the hose.

156
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,092
And she disappeared.

157
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:41,429
So I run back inside
and I tell my parents.

158
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:45,474
And they, uh, sit me down
and give me this big rap

159
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:50,688
on how, when people die, you never
see them again and how I'd imagined it.

160
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,773
But I knew what I'd seen.

161
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,818
I was just glad that I saw it.
I've never seen anything like that since.

162
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,320
But I don't know.

163
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:02,575
It just kinda let me know
how ambiguous everything was.

164
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,243
You know? Even death.

165
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,622
You're really lucky you can
have this attitude toward death.

166
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,919
I think I'm afraid of death
24 hours a day.

167
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,130
I swear.

168
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:19,925
That's why I'm in a train right now.
I could have flown to Paris, but I'm too scared.

169
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,845
- Oh, come on.
- I can't help it. I can't help it.

170
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:26,474
I know the statistics say "na na na,"
it's safer. Whatever.

171
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,977
When I'm in a plane, I can see it.
I can see the explosion.

172
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,480
I can see me falling through the clouds.

173
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:37,902
And I'm so scared of those few seconds
of consciousness before you're gonna die.

174
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,321
You know, when you know
for sure you're gonna die?

175
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,451
I can't stop thinking that way.

176
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,287
- It's — It's exhausting.
- Yeah, I bet.

177
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,498
Really exhausting.

178
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:57,379
- I think this is Vienna.
- Yeah.

179
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,759
- You get off here, no?
- Yeah. What a drag.

180
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,095
I wish I had met you earlier.
I really like talking to you.

181
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,516
Yeah, me too.

182
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,893
It was really nice talking to you.

183
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:45,010
I have an admittedly insane idea,
but if I don't ask you this,

184
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,096
it's gonna haunt me the rest of my life.

185
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,973
What?

186
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:55,646
Um... I want to keep talking to you.
I have no idea what your situation is.

187
00:14:55,729 --> 00:15:01,694
But, uh... But I feel like we have
some kind of a connection, right?

188
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,405
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, right. Well, great.

189
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:08,867
So you should get off the train with me here
in Vienna and come check out the town.

190
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,579
- What?
- Come on. It'll be fun. Come on.

191
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,622
- What would we do?
- I don't know.

192
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:17,626
All I know is I have to catch an Austrian
Airlines flight tomorrow morning at 9:30,

193
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,754
and I don't have enough money for a hotel,
so I was just gonna walk around,

194
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,215
and it'd be a lot more fun
if you came with me.

195
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,595
And if I turn out to be some kind of psycho,
you just get on the next train.

196
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,180
All right, think of it like this. Um...

197
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:36,312
Uh, jump ahead ten, 20 years.
Okay? And you're married.

198
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:40,065
Only your marriage doesn't have
that same energy that it used to have.

199
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,443
You start to blame your husband.

200
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,946
You start to think about all those guys
you've met in your life

201
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,366
and what might have happened
if you picked up with one of them, right?

202
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,619
Well, I'm one of those guys. That's me.

203
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,663
So think of this as time travel
from then to now,

204
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:57,458
to find out what you're missing out on.

205
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:02,296
See, what this really could be is a gigantic
favor to both you and your future husband

206
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,423
to find out that you're not
missing out on anything.

207
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,267
I'm just as big a loser as he is,
totally unmotivated, totally boring,

208
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:10,054
and, uh, you made the right choice
and you're really happy.

209
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,351
I...

210
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:19,647
- Let me get my bag.
- Yeah.

211
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,925
- We should get a locker for all this stuff.
- Okay.

212
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:56,058
- What's your name?
- My name? Uh, it's Jesse.

213
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,644
It's James, actually,
but everybody always calls me Jesse.

214
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:02,064
- You mean Jesse James?
- No, no, just Jesse.

215
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,607
I'm Celine.

216
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,499
- This is a nice bridge.
- Yeah.

217
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,923
- This is kinda weird.
- Yeah, it's kinda weird, isn't it?

218
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,260
I mean, it's a little awkward.

219
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:35,180
- But it's all right, right?
- Yeah, this is great. Let's go to some places.

220
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,575
- Look at your book.
- We're in Vienna. Let's go to some places.

221
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,935
- Look, let's ask these guys.
- Okay.

222
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,438
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

223
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:45,691
<i>- Sprechen sie</i> English?
<i>- Ja.</i> Of course.

224
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,277
- Could you speak German for a change?
- What?

225
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,987
No, it was a joke.

226
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,116
Well, listen, we just got into Vienna today
and we're looking for something fun to do.

227
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,951
Like museums, exhibitions.

228
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,163
But museums are not that funny
anymore these days.

229
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:02,207
Uh, and they are closing right now.

230
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,461
- How long are you going to be here?
- Just for tonight.

231
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,797
Why did you come to Vienna?
What could you be expecting?

232
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,966
Um...

233
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,634
We're on honeymoon.

234
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:16,597
Yeah. She got pregnant.
We had to get married.

235
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,558
No, I don't believe you. You're a bad liar.

236
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,560
Um...

237
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,983
This is, uh — This is a play we're both in.

238
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,360
- And we would like to invite you.
- You're actors?

239
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,821
Not professional actors.
Part-time actors for fun.

240
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:36,241
It's a play about a cow
and the Indians searching for it.

241
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:40,996
- There are also politicians, Mexicans, Russians.
- Communists.

242
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,582
- You have a real cow on stage?
- No, not a real cow.

243
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,210
- It's an actor in a cow costume.
- And he is the cow.

244
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,379
Yes, I am the cow,
and the cow is a bit weird.

245
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:53,217
- The cow has a disease.
- She's acting a bit strange, like a dog.

246
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,136
If someone throws a stick,
she fetches it and brings it back.

247
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,473
And she can smoke
with hooves and everything.

248
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,559
- Great.
- And as you see, there's the address.

249
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:06,271
- It's in the second district.
- Near the Prater. You know the Prater?

250
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:10,609
- Ah, the big Ferris wheel. We should do it.
- Everybody knows the wheel.

251
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:15,614
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play. It starts at 21:30.

252
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,699
- 21:30?
- It's 9:30.

253
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,077
Oh, 9:30. Right, right.

254
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,704
Okay, great. What's the name of this play?

255
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:26,291
It translates as <i>Bring Me The Horns
of Wilmington's Cow.</i>

256
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,419
- I'm Wilmington's cow.
- All right.

257
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,338
- Will you be there?
- We'll try.

258
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,340
- I'm the cow.
- You're the —

259
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,050
Good-bye.

260
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,239
- I got an idea. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

261
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,950
It's Q and A time.
We've known each other a little while now.

262
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:04,204
We're stuck together, so we're gonna
ask each other a few direct questions.

263
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:07,291
- All right?
- So we ask each other questions.

264
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,836
- And you have to answer 100% honestly.
- Of course.

265
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,964
- Okay. All right, first question.
- You.

266
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,300
Describe for me —
Yes, I'm going to ask you.

267
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:22,014
Describe for me your first
sexual feelings towards a person.

268
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,475
My first sexual feelings. Oh, my God.

269
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,060
Um...

270
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,563
I know, I know.

271
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,107
Jean-Marc Fleury.

272
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,109
Jean-Marc Fleury?

273
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,154
We were at this summer camp together,
and he was a swimmer.

274
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,572
Yeah.

275
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,700
He had bleached-out chlorine hair
and green eyes.

276
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:45,287
And to improve his times,
he'd shave the hair off his legs and arms.

277
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,874
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, no. He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

278
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,376
And my friend Emma
had a big, big crush on him.

279
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,755
So one day I was cutting across the field
back to my room

280
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,757
and he came walking up beside me.

281
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,470
And I told him, "You should date Emma
because she has a big crush on you."

282
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:04,806
And he turned to me and said,
"Well, that's too bad,

283
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,434
because I have a big crush on you."

284
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:12,940
So — Yeah. It scared the hell out of me
because I thought he was so fine.

285
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,567
And then he officially
asked me out on a date.

286
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,070
You know, I pretended I didn't like him.

287
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:23,283
You know, I was so afraid
of what I might do.

288
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,285
Uh... Well...

289
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,956
I went to see him swim a few times
at the swimming competition.

290
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,125
He was so sexy, really.
I mean really sexy.

291
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,504
You know, we kind of wrote these
little declarations of love to each other

292
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,255
at the end of the summer

293
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:42,886
and promised we would keep writing forever
and, like, meet again very soon.

294
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,139
- Did you?
- Of course not.

295
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,201
Then I think this is
the opportune time to tell you

296
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,435
that I happen to be a fantastic swimmer.

297
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,271
- Really?
- Yeah.

298
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:56,024
- I'll make note of that.
- Okay. Uh...

299
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,694
- So it's my turn, no?
- All right. Yes, your turn.

300
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,195
- Hit me.
- Um...

301
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,615
Have you ever been in love?

302
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,453
Yes. Next question.

303
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,455
- What was the first —
- Wait a minute.

304
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,517
- So we can give one-word answers?
- Sure. Why not?

305
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,919
No, no. After I went into such private details
about my first sexual feelings?

306
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,130
I know, but those are
two very different questions.

307
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,633
I could answer the sexual feelings thing,
no problem, but love —

308
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,386
What if I asked you about love?

309
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,681
I would have lied, but at least
I would have made up a great story.

310
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,475
You would've lied! Great.
Love is a complex issue.

311
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,477
I mean, it's like, um —

312
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,981
Yes, I have told somebody that I
loved them before, and I had meant it.

313
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:39,693
But was it totally unselfish, giving love?

314
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,529
Was it a beautiful thing? Not really.

315
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,240
It's like, love —

316
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,659
I mean, I don't know.

317
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:49,911
You know?

318
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,663
Yeah, I know what you mean.

319
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:53,874
But as far as sexual feelings go,

320
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:58,837
I'll have you know it started with an obsessive
relationship with Miss July 1978.

321
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,173
- Do you know <i>Playboy</i> magazine?
- Yeah, I've heard of it.

322
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,841
- Do you know Crystal?
- No.

323
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,677
You don't know Crystal?
Well, I knew Crystal.

324
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,764
Um, is it my turn now?

325
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:12,100
Okay, tell me something
that really pisses you off,

326
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:14,102
really drives you crazy.

327
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:18,023
- Pisses me off? Everything pisses me off.
- Okay, list a couple.

328
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,775
Um... Wait, I know.

329
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:23,528
I hate being told by strange men,
a strange man in the street —

330
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:24,863
Yeah?

331
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:29,284
You know, like, to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life.

332
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,119
Um, what else?

333
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:35,040
I hate —
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,

334
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:38,960
there's a war going on, people are dying
and nobody knows what to do about it.

335
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,338
Or they don't give a shit, I don't know.

336
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:45,133
I hate that the medias — You know,
they're trying to control our minds.

337
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,135
- The media?
- Yeah, the media.

338
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:50,472
It's very subtle,
but it's a new form of fascism, really.

339
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,474
Um... Um...

340
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,434
I hate —

341
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:58,396
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,
especially in America — they're the worst.

342
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,901
Each time I wear black or lose my temper
or say anything about anything,

343
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,904
they always go,
"Oh, it's so French, it's so cute."

344
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:09,574
I hate that. I can't stand it, really.

345
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:14,955
- Is that all?
- Well, there's a lot of things, but...

346
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,582
- So, it's my turn.
- Okay.

347
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,127
- You're gonna answer?
- Yes, I'll answer.

348
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,880
- Uh, what's a problem for you?
- You, probably.

349
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,924
What?

350
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:31,221
No. I had a thought the other day
that kind of qualifies as a problem.

351
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,391
- What is it?
- It was a thought I had on the train.

352
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,018
So okay, all right.

353
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,563
Um, do you believe in reincarnation?

354
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,773
- Yeah, yeah. It's interesting.
- Yeah. Right.

355
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:45,610
Most people talk about past lives
and things like that.

356
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:49,865
You know, and even if they don't
believe it in some specific way,

357
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,409
people have some kind of notion
of an eternal soul, right?

358
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,661
- Yeah.
- Okay. Well, this was my thought.

359
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:58,373
50,000 years ago, there were not
even a million people on the planet.

360
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:02,294
10,000 years ago, there's, like,
two million people on the planet.

361
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:06,464
Now there's between five
and six billion people on the planet.

362
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:11,845
Now, if we all have
our own individual, unique soul,

363
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,805
where do they all come from?

364
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:17,642
Are modern souls
only a fraction of the original souls?

365
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,937
'Cause if they are,
that represents a 5,000-to-1 split

366
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,231
of each soul
in just the last 50,000 years,

367
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,650
which is like a blip in the earth's time.

368
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:30,947
So at best, we're like these
tiny fractions of people walking...

369
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:35,368
Is that why we're so scattered?
Is that why we're all so specialized?

370
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,580
- Wait a minute. I'm not sure — I don't agree —
- I know, I know.

371
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,498
It's a totally scattered thought.

372
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,336
Which is kinda why
it makes sense, you know?

373
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,338
I agree with you.

374
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,382

There's even a listening booth over there.

380
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,304
Have you ever heard of this singer?

381
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,892
I think she's American.
A friend of mine told me about her.

382
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:44,229
Do you wanna go and see

406
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,161
- Yeah.
- Ohh.

407
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,747
Hey there, rabbit.

408
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,791
It's so cute.

409
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,920
I visited this
as a young teenager.

410
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,382
I think it left a bigger impression on me
at that time

411
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,134
than any of the museums we went to.

412
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:21,052
Yeah? It's tiny.

413
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,720
I know.

414
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,974
There was this little old man that talked to us.
He was the groundskeeper.

415
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:28,893
He explained that most of the people
buried here,

416
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,729
they'd washed up on the bank
of the Danube.

417
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,983
How old are these?

418
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,569
Around the beginning of the century or so.

419
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:40,464
It's called "Cemetery of the No-Name"
because they often didn't really know

420
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:44,159
who those people were —
maybe a first name, that's all.

421
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:46,453
Why were all the bodies washing up?

422
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:50,498
I think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that.

423
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:53,626
But most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river.

424
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:59,757
I always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world.

425
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:04,137
When I was a little girl, I thought that if none
of your family or friends knew you were dead,

426
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,973
then it's like not really being dead.

427
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,893
People can invent
the best and the worst for you.

428
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,690
Ah, here she is, I think.

429
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,776
Yeah, this is the one I remember the most.

430
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,741
She was only 13 when she died.

431
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:29,370
That meant something to me.
I was that age when I first saw this.

432
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,665
Hmm.

433
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:38,171
Now I'm ten years older
and she's still 13, I guess.

434
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,799
That's funny.

435
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,863
That's the Danube over there.

436
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:07,158
That's a river, right?
- Yeah.

437
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:18,294
This is gorgeous.

438
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,214
Yeah, this is beautiful.

439
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:30,515
And we got, uh... We got a sunset here.

440
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,768
- Yeah.
- We got the Ferris wheel —

441
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:38,606
It seems like, um,

442
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,024
this would be, uh...

443
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:43,111
What?

444
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:48,449
Uh, you know, um...

445
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:56,541
Are you trying to say you want to kiss me?

446
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,127
Yes?

447
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,527
- But you know what?
- What?

448
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,572
I don't think it really matters
what generation you're born into.

449
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,115
Look at my parents.

450
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,660
They were these angry,
young May '68 people

451
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,745
revolting against everything —

452
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:19,207
the government,
their conservative Catholic backgrounds.

453
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,792
I was born not long after.

454
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,294
Then my father went on
to become this successful architect

455
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:28,841
and we began to travel all around the world
while he built bridges and towers and stuff.

456
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:31,636
I mean, I really can't
complain about anything.

457
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,222
You know, they love me more
than anything in the world.

458
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,392
I've been raised with all the freedom
they had fought for.

459
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:40,770
And yet, for me now,
it's another type of fight.

460
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:44,357
We still have to deal with the same old shit,
but we can't really know

461
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,610
who or what the enemy is.

462
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,113
I don't know if there really is an enemy.
You know?

463
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,073
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

464
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:55,451
Rich kids' parents gave them too much,
poor kids not enough.

465
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:58,454
Um, you know, too much attention,
not enough attention.

466
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:01,874
They either left them, or they stuck around,
taught 'em the wrong things.

467
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:06,045
I mean, my parents are just these two people
who didn't like each other very much,

468
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,047
who decided to get married and have a kid.

469
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,717
And they try their best to be nice to me.

470
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,470
- Did your parents divorce?
- Yeah, finally.

471
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,241
They should've done it a lot sooner,
but they stuck together for a while

472
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:20,017
for the well-being of my sister and I,
thank you very much.

473
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:23,104
I remember my mother once —

474
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:26,482
She told me right in front of my father —
They were having this big fight —

475
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,276
that he didn't really want to have me,

476
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:31,696
that he was really pissed off when he
found out that she was pregnant with me,

477
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,322
that I was this big mistake.

478
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,324
That really shaped the way I think.

479
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:39,203
I always saw the world as this place
where I really wasn't meant to be.

480
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,830
That's so sad.

481
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:46,586
Well, I mean, I eventually took pride in it,
like my life was my own doing or something,

482
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,213
like I was crashing the big party.

483
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:52,049
That's the way to see it.

484
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,595
My parents, they're still married,
and I guess they're very happy.

485
00:34:55,678 --> 00:35:00,308
But I think it's a healthy process to rebel
against everything that came before.

486
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:02,643
Yeah. Yeah. But...

487
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:06,939
I've been wondering lately.

488
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:11,277
Do you know anyone
who's in a happy relationship?

489
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,572
Uh, yeah, sure.

490
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,199
I know happy couples.

491
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:19,702
But I think they lie to each other.

492
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,329
Yeah.

493
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,332
People can live their whole life as a lie.

494
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:26,417
My grandmother,
she was married to this man,

495
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:29,837
and I always thought she had
a very simple, uncomplicated love life.

496
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:32,089
But she just confessed to me

497
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:37,261
that she spent her whole life dreaming about
another man she was always in love with.

498
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:40,473
She just accepted her fate. It's so sad.

499
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:44,602
In the same time, I love the idea
that she had those emotions and feelings

500
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,604
I never thought she would have had.

501
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,106
I guarantee you, it was better that way.

502
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,735
If she'd ever got to know him, I'm sure
he would have disappointed her eventually.

503
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,238
- How do know? You don't know them.
- Yeah, I know.

504
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:58,449
It's just, people have these romantic
projections they put on everything

505
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,910
that's not based on any kind of reality.

506
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,745
- Romantic projections?
- Yeah.

507
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:05,248
Oh, Mr. Romantic
up there on the Ferris wheel —

508
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:09,168
- "Oh, kiss me. The sunset. Oh, it's so beautiful."
- All right, all right.

509
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,879
Tell me about your grandmother.
What were you saying about her?

510
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,607
Hey, check these guys out.

511
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,818
"Hey, Hans, I have a confession to make.

512
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,879
I'm not wearing any underwear
underneath this thing."

513
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:38,906
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you?"

514
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:48,499
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

515
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,459
- Come here.
- What?

516
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,295
Come here.

517
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:08,603
Look at this palm reader.
She's interesting-looking, no?

518
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,187
Yeah.

519
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,898
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

520
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:14,775
- I just made eye contact.
- She's not coming over?

521
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,527
- Yeah, she is.
- Oh, shit.

522
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,490
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

523
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,701
- You want your palm read?
- No. Not at all.

524
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,786
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

525
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,663
- Okay.
- Hello.

526
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,165
Here she is.

527
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,504
Uh, <i>Français</i>, English?

528
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,969
I want your palm read.

529
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:46,223
Yeah. How much is it?

530
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:49,310
For you, 50. Okay?

531
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,895
Okay.

532
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:56,817
Oh.

533
00:37:56,901 --> 00:38:00,154
So you have been on a journey

534
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,281
and you are a stranger to this place.

535
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,078
You are an adventurer,

536
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:08,579
a seeker,

537
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,208
an adventurer in your mind.

538
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:20,216
You are interested
in the power of the woman,

539
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:25,429
in a woman's deep strength and creativity.

540
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:27,723
You're becoming this woman.

541
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:38,025
But you need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life.

542
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:41,570
Only if you find peace within yourself

543
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:45,866
will you find true connection with others.

544
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:52,790
- He is a stranger to you?
- Mmm, I guess so.

545
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:01,007
You will be all right. He's learning.

546
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,050
Okay.

547
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,428
Money.

548
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,603
You're both stars.

549
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:16,731
Don't forget.

550
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:19,900
When the stars exploded
billions of years ago,

551
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:22,945
they formed everything that is this world.

552
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:26,032
Everything we know is stardust.

553
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:29,785
So don't forget you are stardust.

554
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,751
I mean, that's very nice and all,

555
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:42,173
I mean, that we're all stardust
and you're becoming this great woman.

556
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:44,258
But I hope you don't
take that any more seriously

557
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:47,261
than some horoscope
in a daily syndicated newspaper.

558
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,263
What are you talking about?

559
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,891
She knew I was on vacation
and that we didn't know each other

560
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:54,226
and that I was going to
become this great woman.

561
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,521
But what was that
"I am learning" bullshit?

562
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,191
That's way condescending, you know?

563
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,193
She wasn't even doing me.

564
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:06,739
I mean, if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth,

565
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,949
it would put their asses out of business.

566
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:12,078
Just once I'd love to see
some little old lady

567
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:15,122
save up all her money
to go to the fortune-teller,

568
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:18,667
she'd get there all excited about hearing
her future and the woman would say,

569
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:23,839
"Uh-huh... Tomorrow
and all your remaining days

570
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:26,092
will be exactly like today,

571
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,803
a tedious collection of hours.

572
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:32,264
And you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts

573
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:34,725
and no new travels.

574
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:37,103
And when you die,
you'll be completely forgotten."

575
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:38,479
You know?

576
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:40,314
"Fifty schillings, please."

577
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,566
That I'd like to see.

578
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:46,695
It's so funny how she almost
didn't notice you, huh?

579
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,572
It's weird. I wonder why.

580
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:51,826
- She was really wise and intense.
- Wi — Yeah?

581
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,161
- I really love what she said.
- Of course you do.

582
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:57,099
You pay your money, you hear something
that makes you feel good about yourself.

583
00:40:57,123 --> 00:41:00,751
If you want, there's a seedy section
of Vienna we can buy a hit of crack.

584
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,753
Would you like that? Huh? Yeah?

585
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:04,755
You're so —

586
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,758
Stardust! Stardust!

587
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,391
Ow!

588
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:18,811
Oh, there's an exhibition.

589
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:22,064
Yup, I guess we'll miss it.

590
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:24,567
Doesn't start until next week.

591
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,569
Yeah, I think so.

592
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:31,574
I actually saw this one
a few years ago in a museum.

593
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,829
I stared and stared at it.
Must have been 45 minutes.

594
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,165
I love it.

595
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:42,334
<i>"La Voie Ferrée."</i> That's great.

596
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,840
I love the way the people seem
to be dissolving into the background.

597
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,886
Look at this one.

598
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:55,764
It's like the environment's,
you know, stronger than the people.

599
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:00,769
His human figures
are always so transitory.

600
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:03,189
It's funny. Transitory?

601
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:05,065
Transitory.

602
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:26,712
- You think this is open?
- I don't know. Let's try it.

603
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:56,200
I was in an old church
like this with my grandmother

604
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:58,202
a few days ago in Budapest.

605
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:03,666
Even though I reject
most of the religious thing,

606
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,669
I can't help but feeling
for all those people

607
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:10,839
that come here, lost or in pain, guilt,

608
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:13,842
looking for some kind of answers.

609
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:19,515
It fascinates me how a single place
can join so much pain and happiness

610
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:22,309
for so many generations.

611
00:43:22,393 --> 00:43:23,936
You close with your grandmother?

612
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,148
Yeah.

613
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:32,695
I think it's because
I always have this strange feeling

614
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:35,656
that I'm this very old woman,

615
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,491
laying down, about to die.

616
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:43,664
You know, that my life is just
memories or something.

617
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:49,295
That's so wild.

618
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:54,300
I mean, I always think that
I'm still this 13-year-old boy

619
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,593
who doesn't really know
how to be an adult,

620
00:43:56,677 --> 00:44:02,558
pretending to live my life, taking notes
for when I'll really have to do it.

621
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:05,936
Kind of like I'm in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play.

622
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:10,566
That's funny.

623
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:14,361
Then up there in the Ferris wheel
was, like, this very old woman

624
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:16,155
kissing this very young boy.

625
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:17,948
- Right?
- Mmm.

626
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:26,498
Do you know anything about the Quakers —
the Quaker religion?

627
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:28,584
- No, not much.
- No?

628
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:31,295
I went to this Quaker wedding once.

629
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:33,547
It was fantastic.

630
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,967
What they do is the couple comes in
and they kneel down

631
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:39,345
in front of the whole congregation,

632
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:41,972
and they just stare at each other.

633
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:43,432
And nobody says a word

634
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:47,936
unless they feel that God moves them
to speak or say something.

635
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:52,941
And then after an hour or so of just, uh,

636
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:55,194
staring at each other,

637
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:57,071
they're married.

638
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,699
That's beautiful. I like that.

639
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:18,967
This is a horrible story.

640
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,053
What?

641
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:23,263
It's not the appropriate place to tell it, but —

642
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:27,059
- What?
- I was driving around with this buddy of mine.

643
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:28,644
He's a big atheist.

644
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:32,314
And we came to a stop
next to this homeless guy.

645
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:35,025
My buddy takes out a hundred-dollar bill,

646
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:38,529
he leans out of the window and he says,

647
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:40,823
"Do you believe in God?"

648
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:44,618
The guy looks at my friend,
he looks at the money,

649
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,120
says, uh...

650
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:48,747
"Yes, I do."

651
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:52,209
My friend says, "Wrong answer."
We drove away.

652
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:56,547
- That's mean, no?
- Yeah. Yeah.

653
00:46:04,263 --> 00:46:05,973
Ow!

654
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:10,352
Would you be in Paris by now
if you hadn't gotten off the train with me?

655
00:46:10,436 --> 00:46:12,020
No, not yet.

656
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,648
What would you be doing?

657
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:17,401
I'd probably be hanging around the airport,
reading old magazines,

658
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:20,154
crying in my coffee
'cause you didn't come with me.

659
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:22,114
Oh! Oh.

660
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:28,912
Actually, I think I'd probably gotten off
the train in Salzburg with someone else.

661
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:31,123
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

662
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,292
So I'm just a dumb American

663
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:37,546
momentarily decorating
your blank canvas, huh?

664
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,798
- I'm having a great time.
- Really?

665
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:41,717
- Yeah.
- Me too.

666
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:47,514
I'm so glad because no one knows I'm here,
and I don't know anyone that knows you

667
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:50,601
that would tell me
all the bad things you've done.

668
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:53,020
- I'll tell you some.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

669
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:56,940
You know, you hear
so much shit about people.

670
00:46:57,024 --> 00:47:00,736
I always feel like the general of an army
when I start dating a guy,

671
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,988
plotting my strategy and maneuverings,

672
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:06,116
knowing his weak points,
what would hurt him, seduce him.

673
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:08,702
It's horrible.

674
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,583
If we were around each other all the time,

675
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:18,045
what would be the first thing about me
that would drive you mad?

676
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:20,589
Mmm — Uh, no, no.
I'm not going to answer this question.

677
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:21,924
- What?
- No.

678
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:25,511
I just — I dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that.

679
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:27,471
- "What about me bugs you?"
- Uh-huh.

680
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:31,391
So finally I said, "Well, I don't think
you handle criticism too well."

681
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:34,645
She flew into a rage and broke up with me.
That's a true story.

682
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:37,314
All she ever really wanted to do
was to have an excuse

683
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,900
to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me.

684
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,527
- Is that what you want?
- What?

685
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,445
- Something about me bugs you?
- No.

686
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:46,615
- Tell me. What is it about me bugs you?
- Nothing at all.

687
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:49,368
If it had to be something,
what would it be?

688
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:53,205
If it had to be something,
if I <i>had</i> to think about it,

689
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:57,000
I kind of didn't really like this reaction
back at the palm reader.

690
00:47:57,084 --> 00:47:59,545
You were like this rooster prick.

691
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:01,880
Rooster prick?
What the hell is a rooster prick?

692
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:06,176
You were like a little boy whining because
all the attention wasn't focused on him.

693
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,388
Listen, this woman robs you blind, okay?

694
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,015
You were like a little boy,
walking by an ice cream store,

695
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:15,060
crying because his mother wouldn't
buy him a milk shake or something.

696
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:18,438
- I don't care what the charlatan has to say —
- Hello.

697
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:20,983
What?

698
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:25,404
Oh. I understand a little bit.

699
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:28,031
But he doesn't at all. I'm sorry.

700
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:30,659
Okay, so, um...

701
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,327
May I ask you a question?

702
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:34,621
Yeah.

703
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:37,583
So, I would like to make a deal with you.

704
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:44,047
I mean, instead of just asking you for money,
I will ask you for a word.

705
00:48:44,131 --> 00:48:46,592
You give me a word. I'll take the word.

706
00:48:46,675 --> 00:48:50,178
Then I will write a poem
with the word inside.

707
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,890
And if you like it, if you like my poem,

708
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:57,019
if you feel it adds something
to your life in any way,

709
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:59,688
then you can pay me
whatever you feel like.

710
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:02,399
I write in English, of course.

711
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:05,319
- Okay.
- All right. Great.

712
00:49:07,821 --> 00:49:09,573
So?

713
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,658
Pick a word.

714
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:14,202
Oh, um —

715
00:49:14,286 --> 00:49:17,914
A word. Um... milk shake.

716
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:22,252
Milk shake. Oh, good. I was gonna say
"rooster prick." But great. Milk shake.

717
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:26,214
Milk shake? Okay. Milk shake.

718
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:29,426
- All right, so, we'll...
- Good.

719
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:44,191
Gotta say I like this
Viennese variation of a bum.

720
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:46,902
I like what he said about
adding something to your life, no?

721
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:48,153
Yeah.

722
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:51,657
So, uh, were we having
our first fight back there?

723
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,659
- No.
- Yeah, I think so.

724
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:55,160
I think we were.

725
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:58,955
Even if we were a little bit, why does
everyone think conflict is so bad?

726
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,166
There's a lot of good things
coming out of conflict.

727
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:05,379
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I don't know.

728
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:09,508
I always think if I could just accept the fact
that my life was supposed to be difficult,

729
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:11,635
that's what's to be expected,

730
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:16,723
then I might not get so pissed off about it
and I'd be glad when something nice happens.

731
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:20,560
Maybe that's why I'm still in school.
It's easier to have something to fight against.

732
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:24,940
Yeah, well, we've all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us.

733
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:27,442
I can be doing the most nothing thing.

734
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:31,154
I can be throwing some darts,
shooting some pool,

735
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:34,157
and all of a sudden
I feel it come over me —

736
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:36,535
I have <i>got</i> to win.

737
00:50:36,618 --> 00:50:40,038
Is that why you tried to
get me off the train — competitiveness?

738
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:41,748
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

739
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,835
Got your poem.

740
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:46,920
Oh, all right.

741
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:50,424
Will you read it to us?

742
00:50:53,677 --> 00:50:55,429
Sure. Okay.

743
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,393
"Daydream delusion,

744
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,270
limousine eyelash.

745
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:06,440
Oh, baby, with your pretty face.

746
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,901
Drop a tear in my wine glass.

747
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:12,237
Look at those big eyes.

748
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,865
See what you mean to me —

749
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:17,659
sweet cakes and milk shakes.

750
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:19,911
I'm a delusion angel.

751
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:23,248
I'm a fantasy parade.

752
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:27,461
I want you to know what I think.
Don't want you to guess anymore.

753
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:30,088
You have no idea where I came from.

754
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:32,174
We have no idea where we're going.

755
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:36,178
Lodged in life like branches in the river.

756
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:39,306
Flowing downstream, caught in the current.

757
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:42,434
I'll carry you. You'll carry me.

758
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:45,145
That's how it could be.

759
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:48,774
Don't you know me?

760
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,817
Don't you know me by now?"

761
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:53,779
Great.

762
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:55,864
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

763
00:51:56,615 --> 00:51:58,116
Uh —

764
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:00,994
Here you go, uh —

765
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:04,498
- Thanks.
- All right.

766
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,875
- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

767
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,919
- Good luck, man.
- Bye.

768
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:10,504
- Bye.
- Bye.

769
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,686
- That's wonderful, no?
- Yeah, yeah.

770
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:33,568
- What?
- You know he probably didn't just write that.

771
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:36,404
He wrote it, but he probably
just plugs that word in —

772
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:38,698
whatever — milk shake, you know.

773
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:40,617
What do you mean?

774
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,786
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

775
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:52,254
- You know what drives me crazy?
- What?

776
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:56,091
There's all these people talking about
how great technology is and how it saves time.

777
00:52:56,174 --> 00:53:01,096
But what good is saved time if nobody uses it,
if it just turns into more busy work?

778
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,222
- Yeah.
- Right?

779
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:06,476
You never hear somebody say, "With the time
I've saved by using my word processor,

780
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,979
I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery
and hang out."

781
00:53:09,062 --> 00:53:10,564
You don't hear that.

782
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:12,941
Time is abstract anyway.

783
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:15,610
- Were you looking at this girl?
- What?

784
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:19,531
- You want to go in here?
- What?

785
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:22,659
- You want to go in here?
- Yeah. It's a club, no?

786
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:24,244
Yeah.

787
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,371
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

788
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:27,831
Hello.

789
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:30,208
Fifty schillings.

790
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:31,793
- Fifty schillings.
- Each.

791
00:53:31,877 --> 00:53:35,046
I got a hundred. Here. I got it.

792
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,257
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

803
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:28,725
All right.

804
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:34,064
You think Old Milwaukee is expensive here?

805
00:54:54,668 --> 00:54:56,169
<i>Merde!</i>

806
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:01,800
Well, um —

807
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:05,845
We haven't talked about this yet,
but are you dating anyone?

808
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:10,433
You got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in Paris or anything like that?

809
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:13,144
- No, not right now.
- Not right — But you did.

810
00:55:14,604 --> 00:55:16,690
We broke up about six months ago.

811
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:17,983
- Six months?
- Yeah.

812
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:19,317
Oh, I'm sorry.

813
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:22,070
I mean, I'm not that sorry.
But tell me about him.

814
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:24,489
Oh, no. No way. I can't.

815
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:27,951
- It's really — really boring.
- Come on, tell me about him.

816
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:32,122
Okay. I was really disappointed.

817
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:34,165
I thought this one would last for a while.

818
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:38,461
I mean, he was very stupid,
ugly, bad in bed,

819
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:41,297
alcoholic, you know.

820
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,217
- A real prizewinner.
- Yeah.

821
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,928
I was kind of giving him a favor,
but he left me,

822
00:55:47,012 --> 00:55:48,930
saying I loved him too much

823
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:52,934
and, you know, I was blocking
his artistic expression and stuff.

824
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:54,811
Shit like that, you know.

825
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:57,313
But anyway, I was traumatized and became —

826
00:55:57,397 --> 00:56:00,442
And became
totally obsessed with him.

827
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:04,446
And so I went to see this shrink, you know,
and it came up that I had written

828
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:08,533
this little, stupid story about this woman
trying to kill her boyfriend...

829
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:13,246
and how she was gonna do it,
you know, all the intricate details.

830
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:16,666
- How to do it and not get caught.
- She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

831
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,126
Yeah.

832
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,587
Yeah, she was. I mean —

833
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:23,590
It's nothing I would do,
but it was just some writing.

834
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,091
No, I understand.

835
00:56:25,175 --> 00:56:27,761
Anyway, this stupid shrink believed
everything I was telling her.

836
00:56:27,844 --> 00:56:29,804
It was my first time seeing her.

837
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:33,224
- She said she <i>had</i> to call the police.
- She had to call the police?

838
00:56:33,308 --> 00:56:38,021
She was — <i>Merde!</i> She was totally
convinced I was really gonna do it.

839
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:41,191
Even though I'd explained to her
it was just some writing and stuff.

840
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:44,444
She said, looking deep into my eyes,
"The way you said it.

841
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:47,238
I know you are going to do it,
the way you said it!"

842
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:49,783
- She was totally out of her mind.
- Aaah!

843
00:56:49,866 --> 00:56:52,368
It was my first and last session.

844
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:54,496
So what happened then?

845
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,206
Hmm.

846
00:56:56,289 --> 00:56:58,458
I totally got over him, you know.

847
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:04,422
But now I'm obsessed that he's gonna die
from an accident a thousand kilometers away.

848
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:07,092
- Oh, right.
- I'm gonna be the one accused.

849
00:57:09,928 --> 00:57:14,015
Why is it you become obsessed with people
you don't really like that much?

850
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:16,434
- You know what I mean?
- I don't know.

851
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:20,688
So how about you?

852
00:57:21,523 --> 00:57:23,983
- What?
- Are you with anyone?

853
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:25,777
Um —

854
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,489
It's funny how we managed
to avoid this subject for so long.

855
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:31,658
Yeah, but now you have to tell me.

856
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:36,496
Well, I kind of see love
as this escape for two people

857
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:38,414
who don't know how to be alone, you know?

858
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:40,667
Or, uh — You know what's funny?

859
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:45,672
People always talk about how love
is this totally unselfish, giving thing.

860
00:57:45,755 --> 00:57:49,134
But if you think about it,
there's nothing more selfish.

861
00:57:49,217 --> 00:57:50,844
Yeah, I know.

862
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:53,888
So, who just broke up with you?

863
00:57:55,807 --> 00:57:57,308
What?

864
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,646
You sound like you've just been hurt
or something.

865
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:03,398
- Oh, do I?
- Yeah.

866
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,024
All right, um —

867
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:07,777
A big confession, you know?

868
00:58:07,861 --> 00:58:10,405
I should have told you this earlier
or something, but...

869
00:58:11,573 --> 00:58:16,286
I didn't come to Europe just to hang out
and read Hemingway in Paris

870
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,246
and shit like that, you know.

871
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:21,624
I saved up my money all spring
to fly to Madrid

872
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:24,335
and spend the summer
with my girlfriend who has been —

873
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:26,337
- Your girlfriend?
- My ex-girlfriend.

874
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:29,799
Who's been in this asinine
art history program for the last year.

875
00:58:29,883 --> 00:58:33,469
Anyway, I got here, right,
and we were reunited at long last,

876
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:37,724
and we went out to dinner our first night
with six of her friends —

877
00:58:37,807 --> 00:58:40,643
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo,

878
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:43,021
Maria, Suzy from home, you know?

879
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:46,691
She pretty much managed to avoid being
alone with me for the first couple of days,

880
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:49,777
and I stuck around for a while
just to kinda let it really sink in

881
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:52,363
that she wished I hadn't come.

882
00:58:53,156 --> 00:58:55,158
So I bought the cheapest flight
out of Europe,

883
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:58,521
this one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow,
but it didn't leave for a couple of weeks,

884
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:01,122
so I bought this Eurail pass, you know.

885
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:04,751
You know what's the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you?

886
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:09,756
- Yeah?
- It's when you remember how little you thought

887
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,883
about the people you broke up with

888
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:15,970
and you realize that that is how little
they're thinking about you.

889
00:59:16,054 --> 00:59:17,597
- Oh.
- You know?

890
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,784
You'd like to think that you're both
in all this pain, but really, they're just,

891
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:22,644
"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

892
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:25,230
Believe me, I know.

893
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:28,900
- You should look at bright colors.
- What?

894
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:31,110
That's what the shrink told me, you know?

895
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:36,282
I was paying her 900 francs an hour
to hear that I was a homicidal maniac,

896
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:40,328
but I could perhaps shift my obsession
if I would concentrate on bright colors.

897
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,455
Well, did it work?

898
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:44,040
Well —

899
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48,086
- It didn't help your pinball.
- Well, no.

900
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:52,131
Yeah, well, you know,
I mean, I haven't killed anyone lately.

901
00:59:52,215 --> 00:59:53,841
- Not lately?
- Mmm.

902
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:55,927
Well, that's good. You're cured then.

903
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:07,188
I mean, there's these breeds of monkeys, right?
And all they do is have sex, like, all the time.

904
01:00:07,272 --> 01:00:12,026
And, uh, they turn out to be the least violent,
the most peaceful, the most happy —

905
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:15,530
You know? So, I mean,
maybe foolin' around's not so bad.

906
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:18,366
- Are you talking about monkeys?
- Yes, I'm talking about monkeys.

907
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:20,535
- Ah, I thought so. Yeah. You know?
- Why?

908
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:24,372
I never heard this one,
but it reminds me of this perfect, you know,

909
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,874
male argument
to justify them fooling around.

910
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:28,960
No, no, no!
Women monkeys are foolin' around too.

911
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:30,545
Everybody's fooling around.

912
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:33,047
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Yeah — That's cute.

913
01:00:33,131 --> 01:00:38,761
You know, I have this awful, paranoid thought
that feminism was mostly invented by men

914
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:41,055
so they could, like,
fool around a little more.

915
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:44,392
You know, "Woman, free your mind.
Free your body. Sleep with me.

916
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:47,770
We're all happy and free as long
as I can fuck as much as I can."

917
01:00:47,854 --> 01:00:50,732
- Ah! All right, all right.
- I'm sure.

918
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,609
But maybe, maybe there's
some biological things at work here.

919
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:55,653
- Biological.
- If you had an island, right?

920
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:56,738
Yeah?

921
01:00:56,821 --> 01:01:00,908
And there were 99 women on the island
and only one man,

922
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:03,703
in a year you'd have
the possibility of 99 babies.

923
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:04,787
Right.

924
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:07,707
But if you have an island with 99 <i>men</i>
and only one woman,

925
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,585
in a year you have the possibility
of only one baby.

926
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:13,046
- So —
- So — You know what?

927
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:15,048
- What?
- On this island, you know,

928
01:01:15,131 --> 01:01:17,967
I think there will be only,
like, maybe 43 men left

929
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:20,931
because they would have killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman.

930
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,430
You know what I mean?

931
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:26,392
And on the other island,
there would be 99 women, 99 babies,

932
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:28,311
and no more men

933
01:01:28,394 --> 01:01:31,105
because they would have all
gotten together and eaten him alive.

934
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:34,609
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
See, I think there's something to that.

935
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:38,571
I think on some level, women don't mind
the idea of destroying a man.

936
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:42,867
Like, I was once walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend, right?

937
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:47,789
We just walked by these real —
four thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

938
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:51,167
And, uh, one of 'em sure enough
says, "Hey, baby, nice ass."

939
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,921
So I'm like, "All right. No big deal.
I'm not gonna get uptight about this."

940
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:58,192
- Yeah, plus, you know, there were four of them.
- Yeah, exactly. There's four of 'em.

941
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:00,277
But she turns around,
she says, "Fuck you, dickheads!"

942
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:03,429
And I'm like,
"Okay, wait a minute here." Right?

943
01:02:03,513 --> 01:02:06,057
They're not gonna come and kick <i>her</i> ass.
Know what I mean?

944
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,560
So who just got pushed to the front line
on that one? You see what I'm saying?

945
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:12,522
I mean, women say they hate it
if you're all territorial and protective,

946
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:16,984
but if it suits them, then they'll tell you
you're being all unmanly or wimpy.

947
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:21,906
You know what? I don't think women
really wants to destroy men. And if —

948
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,867
Even if they want to, they don't succeed.
You know what I mean?

949
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:27,120
I'm sure even men are destroying women —

950
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:30,331
or are capable of destroying women
much more than women.

951
01:02:30,415 --> 01:02:32,834
Well, anyway —
It's depressing. You know what?

952
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:35,545
- What? You wanna stop talking about this?
- Yeah. I hate it.

953
01:02:35,628 --> 01:02:38,464
- Okay. Well, over it.
- You know, man-woman. There's no end to this.

954
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:41,300
- Like — You know.
- It's like a skipping record, you know?

955
01:02:41,384 --> 01:02:42,427
Yeah.

956
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,596
Every couple's been having
this conversation forever.

957
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,307
And nobody came up with anything.

958
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,868
I saw a documentary on that.
It's a birth dance.

959
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:09,036
- A birth dance.
- Yeah.

960
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:39,066
- Should I give her some money?
- Yeah.

961
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,236
Everything that's interesting
costs a little bit of money.

962
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:48,618
So a birth dance, huh?
Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

963
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:51,662
No, but really,
women used it when giving birth.

964
01:03:51,746 --> 01:03:54,207
In some part of the world,
they still do it.

965
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

966
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:58,002
The woman in labor enters a tent,

967
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:00,922
and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance,

968
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:03,341
and they encourage the birthing woman
to dance with them

969
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:05,718
- so as to make the birth less painful.
- Yeah?

970
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:09,096
And when the baby's born,
they all dance in celebration.

971
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,058
Wow. I don't think my mom
would've gone for that.

972
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:15,686
I like the idea of dancing
as a common function in life,

973
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,605
something everybody participates in.

974
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:20,107
Mmm. I know. I heard about this old guy

975
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:23,194
who, uh, was watching
some young people dance,

976
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:25,112
and he said, "How beautiful.

977
01:04:25,196 --> 01:04:28,032
They're trying to shake off their genitals
and become angels."

978
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:30,535
- I like that.
- All right, one question. Back there —

979
01:04:30,618 --> 01:04:34,288
When the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff, right?

980
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:36,958
Where are the men?
Are we out food gathering?

981
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:40,086
Are we not invited?
Y'all don't need us? What?

982
01:04:40,169 --> 01:04:42,588
Men are lucky we don't bite off their head
after mating.

983
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:45,466
Certain insects do that, you know?
Like spiders and stuff?

984
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:47,385
- Mm-hmm.
- We at least let you live.

985
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:49,095
- What are you complaining about?
- Yeah.

986
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:52,265
See, you're officially kidding,
but there's somethin' to that.

987
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:54,642
- You keep bringing stuff like that up.
- What?

988
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:57,144
- Yeah!
- No, no, no. Wait a minute.

989
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:58,854
Talking seriously here.

990
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:01,482
I mean, I always feel this pressure

991
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:04,193
of being a strong and independent icon
of womanhood

992
01:05:04,277 --> 01:05:09,865
and not making — making look like
my whole life is revolving around some guy.

993
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:14,287
But... loving someone, and being loved,

994
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,372
means so much to me.

995
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,375
I always make fun of it and stuff,

996
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:25,256
but isn't everything we dream in life
a way to be loved a little more?

997
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:29,719
Yeah.

998
01:05:29,802 --> 01:05:31,596
I don't know.

999
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:33,889
Sometimes I dream

1000
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:36,934
about being a good father
and a good husband.

1001
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:39,729
- And sometimes that feels really close.
- Hmm.

1002
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:42,440
But then other times,

1003
01:05:43,399 --> 01:05:45,359
it seems silly,

1004
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:48,863
like it would, uh, ruin my whole life.

1005
01:05:49,864 --> 01:05:52,491
And it's not just a — a fear of commitment

1006
01:05:52,575 --> 01:05:55,161
or that I'm incapable of caring or loving,

1007
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:57,747
because... I can.

1008
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:02,418
It's just that...
if I'm totally honest with myself,

1009
01:06:03,169 --> 01:06:07,465
I think I'd rather die knowing
that I was really good at something,

1010
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:10,635
that I had excelled in some way.

1011
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:16,140
You know? Than that I'd just been
in a nice, caring relationship.

1012
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,478
Yeah.

1013
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:23,481
But... I had worked for this older man,

1014
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:27,026
and once he told me
that he had spent all of his life

1015
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:29,070
thinking about his career and his work.

1016
01:06:29,153 --> 01:06:32,114
And... he was 52,
and it suddenly struck him...

1017
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:35,993
that he had never really given
anything of himself.

1018
01:06:36,077 --> 01:06:38,579
His life was for no one and nothing.

1019
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:42,208
He was almost crying saying that.

1020
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:47,963
You know, I believe
if there's any kind of God,

1021
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,174
it wouldn't be in any of us —

1022
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,176
not you or me.

1023
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:55,346
But just this little space in between.

1024
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,394
If there's any kind of magic in this world,

1025
01:07:01,477 --> 01:07:05,272
it must be in the attempt of understanding
someone, sharing something.

1026
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:10,361
I know. It's almost impossible to succeed.

1027
01:07:10,444 --> 01:07:13,489
But... who cares, really?

1028
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:17,576
The answer must be in the attempt.

1029
01:08:25,895 --> 01:08:28,314
I really think this <i>is</i>
a civilization in decline.

1030
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:30,024
- Look at the service.
- The service?

1031
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:33,360
Where is the waitress? In New York,
this person would be out of a job.

1032
01:08:41,577 --> 01:08:44,121
Okay. Now I'm gonna call
my best friend in Paris,

1033
01:08:44,205 --> 01:08:46,749
who I'm supposed to
have lunch with in eight hours.

1034
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,918
- Okay?
- Okay.

1035
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:54,298
Dring. Dring. Dring. Dring.

1036
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:57,426
- Dring. Dring. Pick up!
- What?

1037
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:00,554
- Pick up the phone.
- Uh, oh, hello?

1038
01:09:00,638 --> 01:09:03,098
<i>- Allô? Vani, c'est Celine.</i>
- Mm-hmm?

1039
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:04,642
- Ah!
<i>- Comment ça va?</i>

1040
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:08,395
<i>Ça va bien. Et toi?</i>

1041
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,857
Ah —

1042
01:09:12,775 --> 01:09:16,487
I-I've been workin' on my English recently.
You wanna talk in English? Just for laughs?

1043
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:19,365
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

1044
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:24,328
Um, I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it for lunch today. I'm sorry.

1045
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:28,833
I — I met a guy on the train,
and I got off with him in Vienna.

1046
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:32,211
- We're still there.
- Are you crazy?

1047
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:35,005
Probably.

1048
01:09:35,089 --> 01:09:37,091
Wh-What, he's Austrian? He's from there?

1049
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:39,927
No, no, no, no. He's passing through here too.
He's American.

1050
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:42,054
He's going back home tomorrow morning.

1051
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:44,598
Why'd you get off the train with him?

1052
01:09:44,682 --> 01:09:47,017
Well, he convinced me.

1053
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:49,937
I mean, actually, I was —

1054
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:54,191
I was ready to get off the train with him
after talking to him a short while.

1055
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:56,360
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

1056
01:09:57,653 --> 01:09:59,280
We were in the lounge car,

1057
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:03,492
and he begin to talk about him as a little boy
seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

1058
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:07,496
I think that's when I fell for him.

1059
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:11,709
Just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams.

1060
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,130
- He trapped me.
- Mm-hmm.

1061
01:10:18,299 --> 01:10:20,134
And he's so cute.

1062
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:24,013
He has beautiful blue eyes,
nice pink lips.

1063
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:29,351
Greasy hair! I love it.

1064
01:10:29,435 --> 01:10:32,021
He's kind of tall
and he's a little clumsy.

1065
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:36,650
I like to feel his eyes on me
when I look away.

1066
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,533
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.
It's so cute.

1067
01:10:44,617 --> 01:10:46,994
- What?
- Yeah, we kissed.

1068
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:49,038
It was so adorable.

1069
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:52,249
As the night went on,
I began to like him more and more.

1070
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:55,920
But I'm afraid he's scared of me.

1071
01:10:56,003 --> 01:11:00,215
I told him the story about the woman
that kills her ex-boyfriend and stuff.

1072
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:02,134
He must be scared to death.

1073
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:05,346
He must be thinking
I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

1074
01:11:07,598 --> 01:11:10,267
I just hope he doesn't
feel that way about me.

1075
01:11:10,351 --> 01:11:12,853
Because you know me.
I'm the most harmless person.

1076
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:17,691
The only person
I could really hurt is myself.

1077
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:20,611
I don't think he's scared of you.

1078
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:23,739
- I think he's crazy about you.
- Really?

1079
01:11:23,822 --> 01:11:26,742
I've known you a long time,
and I got a good feeling.

1080
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:29,036
You gonna see him again?

1081
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:32,247
We haven't talked about that yet.

1082
01:11:37,753 --> 01:11:39,964
Okay. It's your turn.
You call your friend.

1083
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:42,007
- Okay?
- Uh — All right, all right.

1084
01:11:42,091 --> 01:11:44,176
Um — Uh —

1085
01:11:44,927 --> 01:11:49,431
Bring, bring, bring. I usually get
this guy's answering machine. Brrring!

1086
01:11:51,225 --> 01:11:52,893
Hi, dude. What's up?

1087
01:11:52,977 --> 01:11:55,980
Uh — Hey, Frank, how ya been?

1088
01:11:56,063 --> 01:11:57,815
Glad you're home.

1089
01:11:57,898 --> 01:12:01,068
Cool. Yeah. So how was Madrid?

1090
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:03,487
Uh, Madrid sucked.

1091
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:07,199
Uh, you know, Lisa and I
had our long-overdue meltdown.

1092
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:09,910
Oh, too bad. I told you, no?

1093
01:12:09,994 --> 01:12:13,038
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The long-distance thing just never works.

1094
01:12:13,122 --> 01:12:15,374
I was only in Madrid for a couple days.

1095
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:17,835
And I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna,

1096
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,920
but, uh,

1097
01:12:20,004 --> 01:12:22,047
you know, it really
wasn't that much cheaper.

1098
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:25,843
I just, uh —
I couldn't go home right away.

1099
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:27,761
I didn't wanna see anybody I knew.

1100
01:12:27,845 --> 01:12:30,305
I just wanted to be a ghost,
completely anonymous.

1101
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:33,976
- So are you okay now?
- Yeah.

1102
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:37,146
Yeah. No, no. Yeah!
I'm great. I'm great. That's the thing.

1103
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:38,564
I'm rapturous.

1104
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:40,983
And I'll tell you why.

1105
01:12:41,066 --> 01:12:43,986
I met somebody on my last night in Europe.
Can you believe that?

1106
01:12:44,069 --> 01:12:46,864
- That's incredible.
- I know. I know.

1107
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:50,325
And you know how they say we're all
each other's demons and angels?

1108
01:12:51,326 --> 01:12:54,288
Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel,

1109
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:57,583
just tellin' me that
everything was gonna be okay.

1110
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:01,754
How did you meet?

1111
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:05,132
- On the train.
- Hmm.

1112
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:09,762
She was sittin' next to this very weird couple
that started fighting, so she had to move.

1113
01:13:09,845 --> 01:13:12,014
She sat right across the aisle from me.

1114
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:14,224
So we started to talk.

1115
01:13:14,308 --> 01:13:16,643
And, uh, she didn't like me much at first.

1116
01:13:16,727 --> 01:13:19,438
She's super-smart, very passionate,

1117
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:22,399
um, and beautiful.

1118
01:13:23,817 --> 01:13:26,695
And I was so unsure of myself.

1119
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:29,156
I thought everything I said
sounded so stupid.

1120
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:34,369
Aw, man, I wouldn't worry about that.

1121
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:37,247
- Nah.
- Nah, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1122
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:40,209
No. And by the way,
she sat next to you, no?

1123
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:42,669
- I'm sure she did it in purpose.
- Oh, yeah?

1124
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:45,214
Yeah.

1125
01:13:47,216 --> 01:13:50,177
Us men are so stupid.
We don't understand anything about women.

1126
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,096
Mm-mmm.

1127
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:54,848
They act kind of strange,
the little I know of them.

1128
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:56,934
Don't they?

1129
01:13:58,352 --> 01:13:59,853
Yeah.

1130
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:07,778
I feel like this is some dream world
we're in, you know?

1131
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:09,822
Yeah, it's so weird.

1132
01:14:09,905 --> 01:14:13,826
It's like our time together is just ours.
It's our own creation.

1133
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:17,871
It must be like I'm in your dream
and you're in mine or something.

1134
01:14:17,955 --> 01:14:19,248
Mm-hmm.

1135
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:23,418
And what's so cool is that this whole evening,
all our time together,

1136
01:14:23,502 --> 01:14:25,879
shouldn't officially be happening.

1137
01:14:25,963 --> 01:14:29,174
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why
this feels so otherworldly.

1138
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:34,763
But then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1139
01:14:34,847 --> 01:14:37,599
- Aaah!
- I know.

1140
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:43,647
But at this time, I think you're supposed to
produce the glass slipper and see if it fits.

1141
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:46,024
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1142
01:14:46,108 --> 01:14:47,734
It'll fit.

1143
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:08,922
This friend of mine had a kid,
and it was a home birth,

1144
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:11,258
so he was there
helping out and everything.

1145
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:14,344
But he said at that profound
moment of birth —

1146
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:19,224
Uh, he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time,

1147
01:15:19,308 --> 01:15:21,685
trying to take its first breath.

1148
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:25,397
All he could think about was
that he was lookin' at somethin'

1149
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,691
that was gonna die someday.

1150
01:15:27,774 --> 01:15:30,402
He just couldn't get it out of his head.

1151
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:34,364
And I think that's so true.
You know, everything is so finite.

1152
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:37,409
I mean, but — but don't you think
that's what, um,

1153
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:40,996
makes our time and specific moments
so important?

1154
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:44,249
Yeah, I know.
It's the same for us tonight though.

1155
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:51,173
After tomorrow morning, we're probably
never gonna see each other again, right?

1156
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:55,302
You don't think
we'll ever see each other again?

1157
01:15:57,763 --> 01:15:59,264
What do you think?

1158
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:03,518
Well — Um —

1159
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,773
Gosh, I don't know. Uh —

1160
01:16:07,856 --> 01:16:10,567
- I mean, I hadn't planned another trip to —
- Uh, me too.

1161
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:13,779
I mean, I live in Paris.
You live in the US. I totally understand —

1162
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:16,156
I'd hate to make you fly.
You hate to fly, right?

1163
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,367
I'm not so scared of flying.

1164
01:16:19,451 --> 01:16:23,372
- I mean, I could.
- Well, if you were gonna come to the US

1165
01:16:23,455 --> 01:16:25,832
or if, you know — I mean, if I —

1166
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:29,253
Or you know, I mean,
I could come back here.

1167
01:16:29,336 --> 01:16:31,463
What? What?

1168
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:34,383
No, let's just be rational adults
about this.

1169
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:37,511
We —

1170
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:39,596
Maybe we should try something different.

1171
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,849
I mean, it's not so bad
if tonight is our only night, right?

1172
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:46,311
People always exchange
phone numbers, addresses.

1173
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:49,231
They end up writing once,
calling each other once or twice.

1174
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:51,233
Right. Fizzles out.

1175
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:53,860
Yeah. I mean, I don't want that.
I hate that.

1176
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:56,488
I hate that too. Yeah.

1177
01:16:57,072 --> 01:17:00,392
Why do you think everybody thinks relationships
are supposed to last forever anyway?

1178
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,494
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1179
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:07,207
But you think tonight's it, huh?

1180
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:10,877
I mean, that... tonight's our only night?

1181
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:15,424
It's the only way, no?

1182
01:17:17,926 --> 01:17:19,553
Well, all right.

1183
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:22,514
Let's do it.

1184
01:17:22,597 --> 01:17:24,599
No delusions. No projections.

1185
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:28,270
We'll just make tonight great.

1186
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:33,650
- Okay, let's do that.
- Okay.

1187
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:52,210
We should do some kind
of handshake, you know?

1188
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:54,046
Give me your hand.

1189
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:56,256
All right.

1190
01:17:57,132 --> 01:18:02,387
To our one and only night together...

1191
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:05,849
and, uh, the hours that remain.

1192
01:18:14,232 --> 01:18:16,568
What?

1193
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:21,198
It's just — It's depressing, no?

1194
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:25,327
Now the only thing we're gonna think of is

1195
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,496
when we're gonna have to
say good-bye tomorrow.

1196
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:29,915
We could say good-bye now.

1197
01:18:29,998 --> 01:18:32,060
Then we wouldn't have to
worry about it in the morning.

1198
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:34,878
- Now?
- Yeah. Say good-bye.

1199
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,505
- Bye!
- Good-bye!

1200
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:38,548
<i>Au revoir!</i>

1201
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:41,009

01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:07,786

1204
01:19:11,248 --> 01:19:12,999
All right. So here's the plan, right?

1205
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:16,211
You're gonna grab the glasses
and I'm gonna get the wine.

1206
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:18,213
- Red wine.
- Red wine. Right.

1207
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:21,466

Hello.

1213
01:19:32,352 --> 01:19:34,396
- Hello.
- Uh —

1214
01:19:36,064 --> 01:19:38,233
- Do you speak English?
- Mmm. A bit.

1215
01:19:38,316 --> 01:19:40,402
- Yeah? A bit? Well — All right.
- Yeah.

1216
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:44,281
I'm having kind of an odd situation,
which is that, um —

01:19:44,364 --> 01:19:46,783
Uh — This is —
You see that girl over there?

01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:53,498
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Well, this is our only night together.

1219
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:57,669
Um, and she, uh —

1220
01:19:57,752 --> 01:20:01,256
All right. Here's the problem. The problem
is that she wants a bottle of red wine.

1221
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:04,176
And I don't have any money.
You see?

1222
01:20:05,927 --> 01:20:08,472
But what I was thinkin' was
that you might wanna, um,

1223
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:11,433
uh, give me the address of this bar —

1224
01:20:11,516 --> 01:20:14,227
No. I know. And I would promise
to send you the money.

1225
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:16,563
And you'd be making our night complete.

1226
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:19,483
- You would send me the money?
- Yes.

<i>♪ Trapeze ♪</i>

1236
01:21:10,534 --> 01:21:13,870
So often in my life I've been with people
and shared beautiful moments

1237
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:17,958
like traveling or staying up all night
and watching the sunrise,

1238
01:21:19,334 --> 01:21:21,586
and I knew those were special moments.

1239
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:24,464
But something was always wrong.

1240
01:21:25,799 --> 01:21:27,884
I wished I'd been with someone else.

1241
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:34,182
I knew that what I was feeling,
exactly what was so important to me,

1242
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:36,268
they didn't understand.

1243
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:43,024
But I'm happy to be with you.

1244
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:48,280
You couldn't possibly know
why a night like this

1245
01:21:48,363 --> 01:21:50,991
is so important to my life right now,

1246
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,701
but it is.

1247
01:21:55,495 --> 01:21:57,914
This is a great morning.

1248
01:21:57,998 --> 01:22:00,000
It <i>is</i> a great morning.

1249
01:22:02,127 --> 01:22:04,504
Do you think we'll have others like this?

1250
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:10,510
- What?
- What about our rational, adult decision?

1251
01:22:10,594 --> 01:22:13,388
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1252
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:19,561
I know what you mean about wishing
that somebody wasn't there though.

1253
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:20,979
Hmm?

1254
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:24,899
It's just usually, it's myself
that I wish I could get away from.

1255
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:28,320
Seriously, think about this.

1256
01:22:28,403 --> 01:22:32,157
I have never been anywhere
that I haven't been.

1257
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,241
Hmm.

1258
01:22:33,325 --> 01:22:37,954
I've never, uh, had a kiss
when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1259
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:42,667
You know, I've never, um, gone to the movies
when I wasn't there in the audience.

1260
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:47,839
I never been out bowling if I wasn't there,
you know, makin' some stupid joke.

1261
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:50,967
I think that's why so many people
hate themselves. Seriously.

1262
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:55,680
It's just that they are sick to death
of being around themselves.

1263
01:22:56,473 --> 01:23:00,143
Let's say you and I
were together all the time.

1264
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:02,562
You'd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms...

1265
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:07,942
and the way, uh — the way every time
that we would have people over, uh,

1266
01:23:08,777 --> 01:23:11,529
I'd be insecure
and I'd get a little too drunk.

1267
01:23:11,613 --> 01:23:17,952
Or, uh, the way I tell the same stupid,
pseudo-intellectual story again and again.

1268
01:23:19,746 --> 01:23:22,374
You see, I've heard all those stories.

1269
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:24,959
So, of course I'm sick of myself.

1270
01:23:26,419 --> 01:23:27,671
But...

1271
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:31,174
being with you, uh,

1272
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:35,345
has made me feel like I was somebody else.

1273
01:23:37,222 --> 01:23:41,184
And the only other way
to lose yourself like that is, um,

1274
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:46,481
you know, dancing or alcohol or...

1275
01:23:47,482 --> 01:23:49,818
drugs and stuff like that.

1276
01:23:52,779 --> 01:23:55,156
Fucking?

1277
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,868
- Fu — Fucking. Yeah. That's one way. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1278
01:24:12,757 --> 01:24:14,718
Do you know what I want?

1279
01:24:15,802 --> 01:24:17,220
What?

1280
01:24:20,348 --> 01:24:22,142
To be kissed.

1281
01:24:25,353 --> 01:24:27,188
Well, I can do that.

1282
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:42,954
Wait. Wait.

1283
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:48,376
I have to say something stupid.

1284
01:24:49,544 --> 01:24:50,962
All right.

1285
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:55,216
- It's very stupid.
- Okay.

1286
01:24:57,135 --> 01:24:59,345
I don't think we should sleep together.

1287
01:25:01,598 --> 01:25:05,143
I mean, I want to, but since we're
never gonna see each other again,

1288
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:08,271
it'll make me feel bad.

1289
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,900
I'll wonder who else you're with.
I'll miss you.

1290
01:25:17,322 --> 01:25:19,866
I know. It's not very adult.

1291
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:22,535
Maybe it's a female thing.
I can't help it.

1292
01:25:23,453 --> 01:25:25,455
Let's see each other again.

1293
01:25:27,582 --> 01:25:31,419
No, I don't want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid.

1294
01:25:32,378 --> 01:25:35,340
I don't wanna just get laid.
I want to, um —

1295
01:25:35,423 --> 01:25:38,718
I mean — I mean, I think we should.

1296
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:42,388
I mean, we die in the morning, right?

1297
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:46,726
- I think we should.
- No. Then it's like some male fantasy.

1298
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:50,355
Meet a French girl on the train,
fuck her and never see her again.

1299
01:25:50,438 --> 01:25:53,066
This great story to tell.
I don't wanna be a great story.

1300
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:56,110
I don't want this great evening
to just have been for that.

1301
01:25:56,194 --> 01:25:57,570
- Okay.
- Okay?

1302
01:25:57,654 --> 01:26:01,074
Okay. We don't have to have sex.
It's not a big deal.

1303
01:26:03,451 --> 01:26:04,953
Okay.

1304
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:14,170
You don't wanna see me again?

1305
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:17,257
No, of course I do. Listen.

1306
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,801
If somebody gave me the choice right now

1307
01:26:19,884 --> 01:26:22,512
of to never see you again or to marry you,

1308
01:26:22,595 --> 01:26:24,347
I would marry you, all right?

1309
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:26,474
And maybe that's
a lot of romantic bullshit,

1310
01:26:26,558 --> 01:26:28,893
but people have gotten married
for a lot less.

1311
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:35,066
Actually —

1312
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:40,071
I think I decided I wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train.

1313
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:46,327
Now that we've talked so much,
I don't know anymore.

1314
01:26:46,411 --> 01:26:49,163
- Oh, God.
- What?

1315
01:26:57,672 --> 01:27:00,133
Why do I make everything so complicated?

1316
01:27:00,216 --> 01:27:02,051
I don't know.

1317
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:07,659
What do you think's the first thing
you're gonna do when you get back to Paris?

1318
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:11,037
Call my parents. What about you?

1319
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:15,416
I don't know. I'll probably go pick up my dog.
He's stayin' with a friend of mine.

1320
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,627
- You have a dog? I love dogs.
- Yeah. You do?

1321
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:20,380
- Yeah.
- Oh. Oh, shit.

1322
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:22,090
- What?
- Oh!

1323
01:28:22,173 --> 01:28:24,759
I don't know. We're back in real time.

1324
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:26,928
I know. I hate that.

1325
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:28,972
What is that?

1326
01:28:30,473 --> 01:28:32,684
Sounds like a harpsichord.

1327
01:28:32,767 --> 01:28:37,063
- Oh, check that out.
- Somebody's playing.

1328
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:38,648
Shh.

1329
01:28:43,069 --> 01:28:44,570
That's cool.

1330
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:00,962
What?

1331
01:29:03,256 --> 01:29:05,675
You ever danced to a harpsichord?

1332
01:29:05,758 --> 01:29:07,176
Of course.

1333
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:14,100
- Oh, wow.
- What?

1334
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:17,937
Uh — I'm gonna take your picture...

1335
01:29:19,313 --> 01:29:21,232
so I never forget you

1336
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:24,777
or, uh — or all this.

1337
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:27,280
Okay. Me too.

1338
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:29,050
"The years shall run like rabbits."

1339
01:30:31,511 --> 01:30:33,262
What?

1340
01:30:34,764 --> 01:30:36,766
Nothin'. Nothin'.

1341
01:30:37,975 --> 01:30:42,647
I have this, uh, recording of Dylan Thomas

1342
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:44,899
reading a W.H. Auden poem.

1343
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:47,235
He's got a great voice.

1344
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:49,237
He just —

1345
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,948
- It's like —
- Hmm? What?

1346
01:30:52,031 --> 01:30:57,411
"All the clocks
in the city began to whir and chime.

1347
01:30:57,495 --> 01:31:00,206
Oh, let not time deceive you.

1348
01:31:00,289 --> 01:31:02,959
You cannot conquer time.

1349
01:31:03,042 --> 01:31:05,253
In headaches and in worry,

1350
01:31:05,336 --> 01:31:08,339
vaguely life leaks away,

1351
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:11,175
and time will have his fancy

1352
01:31:11,259 --> 01:31:13,928
tomorrow or today."

1353
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:16,764
Somethin' like that.

1354
01:31:16,848 --> 01:31:18,349
It's good.

1355
01:31:25,648 --> 01:31:29,652
When you talked earlier
about after a few years

1356
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:31,737
how a couple
would begin to hate each other

1357
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:36,534
by anticipating their reactions
or getting tired of their mannerisms,

1358
01:31:37,618 --> 01:31:40,830
I think it would be the opposite for me.

1359
01:31:40,913 --> 01:31:45,418
I think I can really fall in love
when I know everything about someone —

1360
01:31:46,711 --> 01:31:50,715
The way he's gonna part his hair,
which shirt he's gonna wear that day,

1361
01:31:50,798 --> 01:31:54,552
knowing the exact story
he'd tell in a given situation.

1362
01:31:56,804 --> 01:31:59,307
I'm sure that's when I know
I'm really in love.

1363
01:32:20,912 --> 01:32:22,955
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

1364
01:32:23,748 --> 01:32:25,875
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1365
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:27,376
- Play?
- Yeah.

1366
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:28,878
- The cow?
- Yeah.

1367
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:32,757
Oh, yeah, we didn't.
Oh, no. We missed it.

1368
01:32:58,658 --> 01:33:01,118
Okay. You know what bus
you're taking to the airport, right?

1369
01:33:01,202 --> 01:33:03,204
- Yeah, no problem.
- I should get on this one.

1370
01:33:03,287 --> 01:33:05,331
- Right here? You wanna get on that one?
- Yeah.

1371
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:07,291
Um —

1372
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:09,210
Okay.

1373
01:33:09,293 --> 01:33:11,837
- I guess this is it, no?
- Yeah.

1374
01:33:12,588 --> 01:33:14,215
Um, I really —

1375
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,135
I-I —

1376
01:33:18,219 --> 01:33:20,137
I mean — You know.

1377
01:33:20,221 --> 01:33:22,515
Yeah, I know. Me too.

1378
01:33:24,058 --> 01:33:25,559
I —

1379
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:28,604
My — Yeah.

1380
01:33:28,688 --> 01:33:31,649
Have a great life.
Have fun with everything you're gonna do.

1381
01:33:31,732 --> 01:33:34,277
All right, all right.
Good luck with school and all that.

1382
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,861
Okay.

1383
01:33:35,945 --> 01:33:38,155
Well, I hate this.

1384
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,658
- Me too. The train is about to leave.
- Yeah.

1385
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:53,170
Listen. All this bullshit we were talkin' about —
about not seeing each other again?

1386
01:33:53,254 --> 01:33:55,548
- I don't wanna do that.
- I don't wanna do that either.

1387
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:58,009
- You don't either?
- I was waiting for you to say —

1388
01:33:58,092 --> 01:34:01,220
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid maybe you didn't want to see me.

1389
01:34:01,304 --> 01:34:03,931
Listen, what do you wanna do?

1390
01:34:04,015 --> 01:34:07,226
Maybe — Maybe we should meet here
in five years or something.

1391
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,830
All right, all right.
Five years? Five years? That's a long time.

1392
01:34:09,854 --> 01:34:13,065
Yes, it's awful.
It's like a sociological experiment.

1393
01:34:13,149 --> 01:34:15,318
- How 'bout one year?
- One year. All right. All —

1394
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:18,321
- One — How 'bout six months?
- Six months?

1395
01:34:18,404 --> 01:34:20,156
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be freezing.

1396
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,449
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1397
01:34:21,532 --> 01:34:23,743
Who cares? We come here,
we go somewhere else.

1398
01:34:23,826 --> 01:34:25,828
Okay.

1399
01:34:25,911 --> 01:34:28,914
Uh, six months from now or last night?

1400
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:32,835
- Um — Last night. Six months from last night —
- Okay.

1401
01:34:32,918 --> 01:34:35,671
which was, uh, June 16.

1402
01:34:35,755 --> 01:34:40,343
So, uh, track nine, six months
from now at 6:00 at night.

1403
01:34:40,426 --> 01:34:42,428
- De — December.
- December, yeah.

1404
01:34:42,511 --> 01:34:45,671
It's a train ride for you. I gotta fly
all the way over here and shit like that.

1405
01:34:45,723 --> 01:34:47,308
But I'm gonna be here.

1406
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:49,769
- Okay, me too.
- All right.

1407
01:34:51,771 --> 01:34:54,273
- And we're not gonna call, write or —
- Nah, it's depressing.

1408
01:34:54,357 --> 01:34:56,567
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right.

1409
01:34:57,985 --> 01:35:01,614
All right. Your train's gonna leave.
Say good-bye.

1410
01:35:02,281 --> 01:35:04,283
Bye.

1411
01:35:04,367 --> 01:35:05,701
Good-bye.
